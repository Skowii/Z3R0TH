#3. Pick a Website Builder To get started, you need the tools and instruments to build a website   a website builder is my top choice. Website builders help you build, customize, and manage a website, no matter your skill level. They re a user-friendly option for anyone short on time or lacking confidence when building a site from scratch. The best part is that website builders cater to all users, from beginners looking to create a personal site to industry-leading businesses. For example, Shopify is home to titans of ecommerce, such as Mattel and Gymshark. I had no trouble adding products and setting up an online store with Shopify.

While this gives you total creative control, it s not as accessible or intuitive to use as a website builder, so I d only recommend this route if you have prior building experience.

Business (Including Online Store) Portfolio Informational Blog Find Your Builder Building With AI If you re not too confident when it comes to building a website or you re short on time, AI is the answer. Website builders are jumping on the AI hype   you can start up a conversation with Wix s AI chatbot, let GoDaddy Airo help you build an online presence, or use Squarespace s recently improved Blueprint AI to generate a basic site structure for you. Hostinger s AI builder performed the best overall in our testing, asking only two questions that were clear and relevant. An AI website builder is a great way to save time and energy, whether you use it to create pages or write content. But be wary of overdoing it! AI-generated websites won t be as unique as something you can craft manually. I only had to answer two questions for Hostinger to set me up with a website.

I know that cost is a big concern when building a website, but how much should a website cost? Thankfully, the majority of website builders offer a free plan or free trial. This is a great way to get familiar with a builder before splurging on a premium plan. If you decide to pay for a premium plan, website builders are still considerably cheaper than shelling out for a web developer or designer to build your site, which could cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Website builder plans vary in price, costing around $3 to $30 per month (billed annually). For example, Wix has a free plan and its premium plans cost between $17 and $159 per month (billed annually). However, Web.com came out on top this year as the best value for money website builder we tested, offering an affordable entry point to building a website with its $4.99 per month Website plan, when billed annually.
