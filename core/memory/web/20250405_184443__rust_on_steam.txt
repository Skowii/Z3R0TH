You ll need to brave environmental dangers and deficiencies (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), and scavenge materials. Explore the island and its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments, and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors  BUILD Design and build bases to store your loot, defend your territory, and control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, and commandeer various forms of transportation to traverse the island. Whatever it takes to get ahead. SURVIVE There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armour, and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends, make alliances, and build a settlement together. Explore the island and what s happening in it, trade with other players, or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard-won goods.
