Jackie Niam/Getty Images Generative AI (Gen AI) has advanced significantly since its public launch two years ago. The technology has led to transformative applications that can create text, images, and other media with impressive accuracy and creativity. Also: We have an official open-source AI definition now Open-source generative models are valuable for developers, researchers, and organizations wanting to leverage cutting-edge AI technology without incurring high licensing fees or restrictive commercial policies. Let's find out more. Open-source vs. proprietary models Open-source AI models offer several advantages, including customization, transparency, and community-driven innovation. These models allow users to tailor them to specific needs and benefit from ongoing enhancements. Additionally, they typically come with licenses that permit both commercial and non-commercial use, which enhances their accessibility and adaptability across various applications.

In industries that demand strict regulatory compliance, data privacy, and specialized support, proprietary models often perform better. They provide stronger legal frameworks, dedicated customer support, and optimizations tailored to industry requirements. Closed-source solutions may also excel in highly specialized tasks, thanks to exclusive features designed for high performance and reliability. When organizations require real-time updates, advanced security, or specialized functionalities, proprietary models can offer a more robust and secure solution, effectively balancing openness with the rigorous demands for quality and accountability. The Open Source AI Definition The Open Source Initiative (OSI) recently introduced the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) to clarify what qualifies as genuinely open-source AI. To meet OSAID standards, a model must be fully transparent in its design and training data, enabling users to recreate, adapt, and use it freely. Also: Can AI even be open source? It's complicated However, some popular models, including Meta's LLaMA and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, have licensing restrictions or lack transparency around training data, preventing full compliance with OSAID. As part of the OSAID validation process, OSI assessed the following: Compliant models: Pythia (Eleuther AI), OLMo (AI2), Amber and CrystalCoder (LLM360), and T5 (Google). Pythia (Eleuther AI), OLMo (AI2), Amber and CrystalCoder (LLM360), and T5 (Google). Potentially compliant models: Bloom (BigScience), Starcoder2 (BigCode), and Falcon (TII) could meet OSAID standards with minor adjustments to licensing terms or transparency. Bloom (BigScience), Starcoder2 (BigCode), and Falcon (TII) could meet OSAID standards with minor adjustments to licensing terms or transparency. Non-compliant models: LLaMA (Meta), Grok (X/Twitter), Phi (Microsoft), and Mixtral (Mistral) lack the necessary transparency or impose restrictive licensing terms. The OSAID has sparked notable dissent among prominent open-source community members. Because it diverges from the traditional open-source definition used for software, its relevance and impact on open-source generative AI models have stirred intense debate across community forums, including the Open Source Definition's bulletin boards (an alternative organization to the OSI), developer mailing lists, and public platforms like LinkedIn. LLaMA and other non-compliant architectures The Meta LLaMA architecture exemplifies noncompliance with OSAID due to its restrictive research-only license and lack of full transparency about training data, limiting commercial use and reproducibility. Derived models, like Mistral's Mixtral and the Vicuna Team's MiniGPT-4, inherit these restrictions, propagating LLaMA's noncompliance across additional projects. Also: Want to work in AI? How to pivot your career in 5 steps Beyond LLaMA-based models, other widely used architectures face similar issues. For example, Stability Diffusion by Stability AI employs the Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license, which includes ethical restrictions that deviate from OSAID's requirements for unrestricted use. Similarly, Grok by xAI combines proprietary elements with usage limitations, challenging its alignment with open-source ideals. These examples underscore the difficulty of meeting OSAID's standards, as many AI developers balance open access with commercial and ethical considerations. Implications for organizations: OSAID compliance vs. non-compliance Choosing OSAID-compliant models gives organizations transparency, legal security, and full customizability features essential for responsible and flexible AI use. These compliant models adhere to ethical practices and benefit from strong community support, promoting collaborative development. In contrast, non-compliant models may limit adaptability and rely more heavily on proprietary resources. For organizations that prioritize flexibility and alignment with open-source values, OSAID-compliant models are advantageous. However, non-compliant models can still be valuable when proprietary features are required. Understanding licensing in open-source AI models Open-source AI models are released under licenses that define usage, modification, and sharing conditions. While some licenses align with traditional open-source standards, others incorporate restrictions or ethical guidelines that prevent full OSAID compliance. Key licenses include: Apache 2.0 : A permissive license that allows free use, modification, and distribution, along with a patent grant. Apache 2.0 is OSI-approved and popular for open-source projects, providing flexibility and legal protection.

Like Apache 2.0, MIT is OSI-approved, widely adopted, and offers simplicity and minimal restrictions. Another permissive license that only requires attribution for reuse. Like Apache 2.0, MIT is OSI-approved, widely adopted, and offers simplicity and minimal restrictions. Creative ML OpenRAIL-M : A license designed for AI applications, allowing broad use but imposing ethical guidelines to prevent harmful use. OpenRAIL-M is not OSI-approved because it includes usage restrictions that conflict with the OSI's principles of unrestricted freedom. However, it is valued by developers aiming to prioritize ethical use in AI. A license designed for AI applications, allowing broad use but imposing ethical guidelines to prevent harmful use.
