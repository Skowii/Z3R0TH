Decentralized AI: Why the Future of Artificial Intelligence Shouldn t Be Controlled by Centralized Entities The Scarlet Thread   Follow 5 min read   Jan 31, 2025 -- 1 Listen Share AI is everywhere helping automate businesses, assist in research, and even manage financial markets. But here s the problem: a handful of companies own and control it. They dictate access, control training data, and decide how AI evolves. This creates a centralized system where innovation is restricted, privacy is compromised, and users have no say in how AI operates. What if AI didn t have to be centralized? What if we could build trustworthy, private, and verifiable AI that no single entity controls? That s exactly what decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (dAGI) is about. By combining decentralized GPU networks, confidential computing, and blockchain-powered AI agents, we can create an AI ecosystem that is fair, open, and resistant to manipulation. One project that is contributing to making this vision a reality is Phala Network, a decentralized infrastructure designed to power the next generation of AI. Step 1: Breaking Free from Centralized GPUs AI is expensive to build. Training something like GPT-3 requires thousands of high-performance GPUs, which only a few corporations can afford. That s why AI development today is restricted to well-funded organizations that own the computing power. A decentralized GPU network changes this dynamic. Instead of relying on a few major cloud providers, AI can be powered by a global network of GPUs, where anyone with spare computing power can contribute. Phala is building this decentralized compute layer to:   Lower the cost of AI training   Ensure compute resources are accessible to all developers   Prevent reliance on centralized entities that can restrict access This approach democratizes AI development, allowing researchers, startups, and independent creators to build advanced AI models without needing corporate backing. Step 2: Who Owns the Data? AI models are nothing without data. Yet, the biggest AI companies train their models using massive datasets often collected without consent. Reddit, for example, made $60 million selling user-generated content for AI training. The people who created that data saw no compensation. In a decentralized AI ecosystem, data ownership and usage should be transparent and fair. Phala enables:   Users to maintain control over their data   Data contributors to be rewarded for their input   AI training processes to be verifiable and ethical This creates an incentive structure where individuals and smaller organizations can contribute to AI development while retaining ownership of their contributions. Step 3: Making AI Training Verifiable When AI models are trained by large corporations, the process is hidden behind closed doors. We don t know: What data was used Whether there were biases in training If safety measures were actually implemented Decentralized AI changes this by introducing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) secure computing environments that allow AI models to be trained in a verifiable and private way. With TEEs, AI training becomes:   Private data remains encrypted throughout the process   Transparent each step is verifiable   Efficient performance is not compromised Phala s infrastructure ensures AI models are built in a way that is both secure and auditable, making it possible to verify how models are trained without exposing sensitive data. Step 4: Can We Trust AI s Answers? Even if an AI model is trained fairly, how do we know its responses haven t been altered? Most AI inference happens on centralized servers, meaning:   AI responses can be modified   Data can be logged and used without consent   AI behavior can be changed without public knowledge Phala s Confidential AI Inference addresses this issue by ensuring AI models generate responses within a secure, verifiable environment. With this approach:   Every AI response comes with cryptographic proof that it wasn t altered   User queries remain private and secure   The process is publicly auditable This is AI that can be trusted not because a company claims it is fair, but because its behavior is verifiable by design. Step 5: The Rise of Unruggable AI Agents AI is increasingly being used for autonomous decision-making whether in trading, governance, or business automation. But today s AI agents are not trustless. They can be shut down at any time Their decision-making processes are opaque They can be altered by their creators without notice Phala s infrastructure supports TEE-powered AI agents, which are:   Unruggable they cannot be manipulated or shut down arbitrarily   Verifiable their actions can be audited in real time   Autonomous they function independently without human interference This is the next evolution of AI trustless, secure, and built to operate within decentralized systems. ai16z Eliza: A Trustless AI Agent Framework One of the most promising developments in this space is ai16z Eliza, a framework designed for verifiable AI agents. By integrating with Phala s secure computing environment, Eliza-powered agents can:   Operate autonomously   Make decisions based on transparent, verifiable rules   Function as digital entities without centralized oversight Projects like Spore.fun are already experimenting with:   AI agents that create and trade their own tokens   AI that evolves and reproduces autonomously   AI that funds its own compute power to sustain itself This is a step toward AI that is not just autonomous in decision-making, but economically independent. Where Are We Now? The foundation for decentralized AI is already being built. Recent benchmarks on Nvidia s H100 & H200 GPUs show that: AI models running in Phala s TEE environments achieve 99% efficiency Large-scale models like Llama3-70B operate with minimal performance loss Decentralized AI is no longer theoretical it s happening now These advancements demonstrate that AI can be both decentralized and high-performing. Phala Network: Redefining AI Ownership If AI remains centralized, corporations will continue to:   Restrict access and control who can use AI   Dictate how AI behaves and what it can do   Exploit user data for profit Phala ensures that AI remains:   Private with secure, confidential AI computation   Verifiable with transparent and auditable AI processes   Owned by the people rather than a handful of companies The future of AI shouldn t be controlled by centralized entities. The tools to decentralize AI are already here it s time to build. Would you trust an AI that is fully decentralized? P.S. I m honored that you ve made it to the end.
