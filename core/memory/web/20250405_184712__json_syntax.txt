JSON Syntax The JSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript syntax. JSON Syntax Rules JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax: Data is in name/value pairs Data is separated by commas Curly braces hold objects Square brackets hold arrays JSON Data - A Name and a Value JSON data is written as name/value pairs (aka key/value pairs). A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value: Example "name":"John" JSON names require double quotes. JSON - Evaluates to JavaScript Objects The JSON format is almost identical to JavaScript objects. In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes: JSON {"name":"John"} In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names: JavaScript {name:"John"} JSON Values In JSON, values must be one of the following data types: a string a number an object an array a boolean null In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including: a function a date undefined In JSON, string values must be written with double quotes: JSON {"name":"John"} In JavaScript, you can write string values with double or single quotes: JavaScript {name:'John'} JavaScript Objects Because JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, very little extra software is needed to work with JSON within JavaScript. With JavaScript you can create an object and assign data to it, like this: Example person = {name:"John", age:31, city:"New York"}; You can access a JavaScript object like this: Example // returns John person.name; Try it Yourself   It can also be accessed like this: Example // returns John person["name"]; Try it Yourself   Data can be modified like this: It can also be modified like this: You will learn how to convert JavaScript objects into JSON later in this tutorial. JavaScript Arrays as JSON The same way JavaScript objects can be written as JSON, JavaScript arrays can also be written as JSON. You will learn more about objects and arrays later in this tutorial.
