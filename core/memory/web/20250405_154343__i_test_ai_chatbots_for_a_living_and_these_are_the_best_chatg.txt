With the release of OpenAI's GPT-4.5 model, CEO Sam Altman noted that it is their most human-like model yet with enhanced emotional intelligence and conversational abilities. But while ChatGPT may have been the first generative AI chatbot to gain mainstream adoption, in a growing and crowded market, is it still the best choice? ChatGPT recently introduced Deep Research, an AI agent integrated into ChatGPT that autonomously browses the web to generate cited reports on user-specified topics within 5 to 30 minutes. This tool interprets and analyzes text, images, and PDFs, aiming to provide expert-level analysis efficiently.  However, since this launch, other chatbots such as Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok all have a deep reserach feature. ChatGPT also offers a scheduled Tasks feature, enabling users to instruct ChatGPT to perform actions at future times. While there aren't competitive models with this exact feature, Gemini can integrate within Google Calendar to offer reminders and set tasks. Despite ChatGPT continually attempting to pull ahead, the rest of the tech sector hasn t sat back and let OpenAI dominate. Some of its competitors equal or exceed the abilities of ChatGPT and others offer features it doesn t. From Claude and Google Gemini to Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity, these are the best ChatGPT alternatives right now. I test AI apps for a living and I ve pulled together some of the best ChatGPT alternatives that I've tried myself and can recommend. Best Overall: Anthropic Claude (Image credit: Anthropic) Anthropic has introduced several notable updates to its AI assistant, Claude that make it a good ChatGPT alternative. In some cases, I d argue that it is currently better than ChatGPT overall. It has better reasoning and persuasion and isn t as lazy. It will create a full app or write an entire story and is funnier than OpenAI's flagship product.  On February 24, 2025, Anthropic unveiled Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a model integrating advanced reasoning capabilities. This allows users to choose between rapid responses and more detailed, step-by-step reasoning, enhancing flexibility and user experience. Alongside Claude 3.7, Anthropic launched a research preview of Claude Code, an agentic command-line tool enabling developers to delegate coding tasks directly from their terminals, streamlining coding workflows.   Anthropic recently updated its API to include cache-aware rate limits, simplified prompt caching, and token-efficient tool use. These enhancements allow developers to increase throughput and reduce token usage with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.   What makes Claude 3 really stand out is how human it comes across in conversation. The context window for Claude is also one of the largest of any AI chatbot with a default of about 200,000, rising to 1 million for certain use cases. This is particularly useful now Claude includes vision capabilities, able to easily analyze images, photos and graphs. The biggest issue with Claude is its relatively low rate limits. If you are a heavy user you'll very quickly hit the 'no more messages' warning with no way to increase the number of messages. You will have to switch to Opus or the tiny Haiku model until the message limit resets in 3-5 hours. Claude has no image generation capabilities although it is particularly good at providing prompts you can paste into an image generator such as Midjourney. It is also better at coding than some of the other models. One of the biggest selling points for Claude though is the additional features. When Sonnet 3.5 launched we saw the arrival of Artifacts, a tool that lets you run code in the browser or even save content created by Claude for use elsewhere. Further to this, Claude now also has a project library feature for shared work and ideas. Alongside Sonnet 3.5, Anthropic introduced Claude 3.5 Haiku. On many evaluations, this model matches the performance of the prior largest model, Claude 3 Opus, while operating at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku. This model is well-suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from large volumes of data. The release of desktop applications for Windows and macOS, and the addition of dictation support, allow users to engage with Claude directly from their computers, eliminating the need to switch between devices. This integration facilitates seamless multitasking, enabling users to incorporate Claude's functionalities into various applications such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations without relying solely on the web interface. Anthropic has also introduced the Analysis Tool within Claude.ai, enabling Claude to write and execute JavaScript code. This feature allows Claude to process data, conduct analyses, and produce real-time insights directly within the platform. Users can upload data files, such as CSVs, and Claude can perform tasks like data cleaning, exploration, and analysis, providing precise and reproducible results. Claude has expanded its accessibility by launching desktop applications for Windows and Mac. These applications offer the same functionalities as the web version, including the ability to ask questions, access previous chats, and view starred conversations. Additionally, voice dictation support was added to Claude's mobile apps, allowing users to input queries via voice. These developments further underscore Claude's commitment to providing a more integrated and efficient user experience. Pricing: Claude costs $20 a month for the Plus version with Opus. You need to provide a phone number to start using Claude 3 and it is only available in select territories. Best for Live Data: Google Gemini (Image credit: Google) Google s chatbot started life as Bard but was given a new name   and a much bigger brain   when the search giant released the Gemini family of large language models. It is a good all-around chatbot with a friendly turn of phrase. However, it is also one of the most cautious and tightly moderated. For example, it'll flat-out refuse to discuss certain topics, won't create images or even prompts for images of living people, and stop responding if it doesn't like the conversation. It is getting better though. Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, marking a substantial advancement in its AI capabilities. This update introduced features such as multimodal Live API, which enables real-time audio and video interactions, allowing Gemini to process and respond to various data types simultaneously. The ability to comprehend and interact with spatial information was also enhanced when Gemini 2.0 was introduced. Google enhanced its Android OS and Pixel devices with new AI-powered features, including: Expressive captions: An extension of the Live Caption feature that delivers text for nearly any media on the phone, capturing non-speech elements like sighs and gasps using on-device AI. Improved image descriptions: The Lookout app received enhancements using a more advanced language model, providing better descriptions for images. Spotify extension for Gemini: Allowing users to interact with Spotify through the Gemini chatbot, facilitating music discovery and playback. Enhanced document scanning: Google Drive on Android now offers improved document scanning capabilities. Quick share with QR codes: Simplifying the sharing process by generating QR codes for easy content transfer. Personalized interactions: "Saved info with Gemini" feature enables more personalized user interactions. Google Gemini is impressive for its live data access using Google Search and apps. Like ChatGPT, Google Gemini has its own image generation capabilities. This new model allows Gemini to generate images and convert text to speech with adjustable parameters. We are seeing enhanced ability to perform tasks autonomously, as well as functionalities like Google Search within Gemini. It uses the impressive Imagen 3 model and can create compelling, photorealistic images. You can only create pictures of people (as long as they don't exist) with a Gemini Advanced subscription. Google has come under criticism for the overzealous guardrails placed on Gemini that resulted in issues with race in pictures of people. The response was to just stop it making images of people   that still hasn't been lifted. What Google does have, although it doesn't work as well as ChatGPT for this purpose, is live access to Google Search results. This means you can get specific information not in the training data and citations to the source of the content. This works best when connected to Google products. Gemini has tight, opt-in, integration with Maps, Gmail, Docs and other Google products. Google has recently made Gemini's most advanced features free for users. In addition, Google has introduced Gemini Canvas, an interactive workspace for refining documents and code, and Audio Overview, a feature that transforms everything from single files to Deep Research reports into podcast-style discussions.. Both free and paid tiers have access to Gemini 2.0. The paid-for version uses the more powerful Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini 2.0. It previously used Gemini Ultra 1.0 but Pro 1.5 outperforms the bigger model on benchmarks. I suspect when Ultra 1.5 launches it will be included with Gemini Advanced. It also includes access to Gemini live, Google's answer to ChatGPT Advanced Voice which lets you have a voice conversation with the AI. It works surprisingly well with a wide range of voices and styles. Pricing: Gemini Advanced is the paid for version and is available for $19.99 bundled with the Gemini One subscription service. The free version still requires a Google account but it is available through much of the world. Most Creative: Microsoft Copilot (Image credit: Microsoft Copilot) Microsoft Copilot has had more names and iterations than Apple has current iPhone models   well not exactly but you get the point. The latest update includes GPT-4o, the most powerful natively multimodal model from OpenAI. This brings with it improved reasoning and understanding, as well as better AI vision capabilities. It also has a new look and voice mode. With the major redesign published in October, Microsoft made it more like Pi than ChatGPT, surfacing content more easily and a new focus on its voice mode. Microsoft Copilot includes a range of impressive add-ons and access to 365 apps It was first launched in a couple of versions as Bing Chat, Microsoft Edge AI chat, Bing with ChatGPT and finally Copilot. Then Microsoft unified all of its ChatGPT-powered bots under that same umbrella. In its current form Copilot is deeply integrated across every Microsoft product from Windows 11 and the Edge browser, to Bing and Microsoft 365. Copilot is also in enterprise tools. While it is powered by OpenAI s GPT-4o, Copilot is still very much a Microsoft product. Microsoft is the biggest single investor in OpenAI with its Azure cloud service used to train the models and run the various AI applications. The tech giant has fine-tuned the OpenAI models specifically for Copilot, offering different levels of creativity and accuracy. Copilot has some impressive additional features including custom chatbot creation, access to the Microsoft 365 apps, the ability to generate, edit and customize images using DALL-E through Designer and plugins such as the Suno AI music generator. Microsoft Copilot Vision, an AI tool that allows Copilot to see what users are viewing in their internet browser, aids in navigation and information retrieval by scanning webpages and providing relevant answers, creating a more interactive and personalized web browsing experience. The AI's voice mode is built on top of OpenAI's Advanced Voice and unlike the ChatGPT product, Copilot Voice is available for free and I found it more conversational. Just this year, Microsoft announced the inclusion of AI-powered features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions for an additional $3 per month, compared to the previous $20 monthly fee for the Copilot Pro subscription. Existing subscribers can opt out of these AI features to avoid the price increase. This integration follows months of testing and is now available globally. These updates demonstrate Microsoft's ongoing efforts to integrate AI capabilities across its product ecosystem, enhancing user experience and productivity. Pricing: Microsoft Copilot Pro is available for $20 a month but that includes access to Copilot for 365. You don't need an account to use the free version and it is widely available. Best for Research: Perplexity (Image credit: Perplexity) While Perplexity is marketed more as an alternative to Google than an AI chatbot, it let syou ask questions, follow-ups and responds conversationally. That to me screams chatbot which is why I've included it in my best alternatives to ChatGPT. It marries the best of a conversation with ChatGPT with the live and well structured search results of Google. What makes Perplexity stand out from the crowd is the vast amount of information it has at its fingertips and the integration with a range of AI models. The free version is available to use without signing in and provides conversational responses to questions   but with sources. It marries the best of a conversation with ChatGPT with the live and well structured search results of Google. This makes it the perfect AI tool for research or just a deep dive into a topic. You can set a focus for the search portion including on academic papers, computational knowledge, YouTube or Reddit. You can also disable web search and just use it like ChatGPT. Perplexity also now has a Pages feature that lets you collate your searching into a single, shareable webpage. Perplexity launched a shopping hub to enhance user experience in product searches. Supported by Amazon and Nvidia, this feature presents product cards displaying relevant items in response to shopping-related queries, aiming to streamline the shopping process for users. Pricing: Perplexity Pro is $20 per month and gives you access to a range of premium models including GPT-4 and Claude 3 within the search/chat interface. Most personal: Inflection Pi (Image credit: Inflection) Pi from Inflection AI is my favorite large language model to talk to. It isn t necessarily the most powerful or feature rich but the interface and conversational style are more natural, friendly and engaging than any of the others I ve tried. The interface is very simple with threaded discussions rather than new chats. Evening the welcome message when you first open Pi is friendly, stating:  My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let s talk about whatever s on your mind.  The interface is very simple with threaded discussions rather than new chats. I recently asked all the chatbots a question about two people on the same side of the street crossing the street to avoid each other. Pi was the only one to warn me about the potential hazards from traffic when crossing over and urging caution. Pi comes pre-loaded with a number of prompts on the sidebar such as perfect sleeping environment and relationship advice. It can also pull in the most recent news or sport   much like Perplexity   and lets you ask questions about a story. Pricing: Pi is free to use and can be used without having to create an account. It also has a voice feature for reading messages out loud. Best for Social: xAI Grok (Image credit: xAI Grok) Elon Musk s Grok is almost the anti-Pi. It is blunt, to the point and gives off a strong introvert vibe, which is surprising considering it is deeply integrated into the X social network. Its guardrails are less tightly wound than others. Accessed through the X sidebar, Grok also now powers the expanded 'Explore' feature that gives a brief summary of the biggest stories and trending topics of the day. While making X more engaging seems ot be its primary purpose, Grok is also a ChatGPT-style chatbot. Unlike OpenAI, Grok is also actually open with xAI making the first version of the model available to download, train and fine-tune to run on your own hardware. The big differentiator for Grok is what Elon Musk calls  free speech . Its guardrails are less tightly wound than others. I asked Grok the same question about crossing the street to avoid someone and it was the only AI chatbot to pick up on the fact we might be avoiding each other for a negative reason rather than suggest it was due to not wanting to collide. With the launch of Grok 3 you can now make images, code and get deeper insights into trending topics. Its image generation capability is powered by Flux. The xAI introduced Aurora, a text-to-image generation model, enhancing Grok's capabilities by allowing users to generate images based on textual descriptions. Grok can comprehend and interpret images, enabling users to upload visuals and receive detailed analyses. This advancement marked Grok's progression towards multimodal functionality. xAI integrated web search capabilities into Grok, allowing the chatbot to access and provide up-to-date information from the internet, thereby enhancing the relevance and accuracy of its responses. Grok's deep research feature is available to users with a Pro Grok account. Grok has also gained the ability to process and understand PDF documents, enabling users to upload PDFs and receive summaries or answers to specific questions about the content. xAI released a standalone Grok app for iOS in the United States, expanding access beyond the X platform. The app offers functionalities similar to the integrated chatbot, including real-time information retrieval, question answering, and image generation. Pricing: Grok is now available and free for all X users. Grok Pro is $40 per month. Best for open source: Llama 3.2 (Image credit: Llama 2 on Groq) Meta is one of the biggest players in the AI space and open sources most of its models including the powerful multimodal Llama 3.2 large language model. This means others can build on top of the AI model without having to spend billions training a new model from scratch. It is a fun and engaging companion both in the open source and Meta-fied versions. Llama 3.1 was launched in July and comes with three sizes, 8 billion parameters, 70 billion and the new frontier-grade 405 billion parameter version. This was followed by Llama 3.2 in September in two smaller sizes, and an 11b and 90b version that can analyze images. The latest version is Meta's Llama 3.3, a new 70-billion-parameter AI model that performs comparably to its 405-billion-parameter predecessor but with greater efficiency. This release is part of Meta's strategy to expand the use cases for its Llama system and encourage more developers to build on its open-source AI protocols. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted that Llama has become the most adopted AI model globally, with over 650 million downloads. This model powers Meta AI, the virtual assistant in the Ray-Ban smart glasses, Instagram and WhatsApp as well as its own standalone MetaIA (see below). The company says it wants to eventually make MetaAI the greatest virtual assistant on the market and will continue to invest in new models. Llama 4 is expected to require 10 times more training resource than Llama 3. Llama 3.1 is engaging, widely accessible and open. It is a big improvement on the previous version which had some refusal issues and too tight guardrails. There is also a much larger version of Llama 3 coming which will change the game. Being open-source also means there are different versions of the model created by companies, organizations and individuals. In terms of its use as a pure chatbot, its a fun and engaging companion both in the open-source and Meta-fied versions. Pricing: Llama 3 is completely free, available through MetaAI in WhatsApp, to install locally or through a third-party service such as Groq , Perplexity or Poe. Most fun: MetaAI (Image credit: Meta) Powered by a customized version of Llama 3 specifically designed for Meta products, MetaAI is a new standalone chatbot from the social media giant. You can already access versions of the AI model in each of those tools   but they'll likely come together soon. Approaching 600 million users, Meta AI stands out as a versatile, accessible chatbot, integrated across popular social media platforms including Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It excels in creating up to 100 images per day, including animated images a unique feature among its competitors. With its human-like responses, it is valuable for handling customer inquiries, assisting with research, and summarizing articles. Though still in beta, Llama 3.1-405B, offers real-time access to Bing and Google so users stay informed with up-to-date responses. Overall, Meta AI is a great tool for content creation and social engagement. The AI includes an impressive voice mode, with celebrity voices such as Dame Judi Dench, as well as image analysis functionality. Pricing: Meta.ai is completely free but you need a Facebook account. It also only works in the U.S. at the moment. More choice: Poe (Image credit: Poe) Poe is different to most of the other chatbots we've included in that it isn't its own model, rather a collection of every model so you can see how they compare. Some are completely free, others come with a 'compute' cost including the new Llama 3.1 405b frontier model. As well as a choice of open-source options you can access models from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google all from the same site. Poe also has a selection of community-created pots and custom models designed to help you craft the perfect prompt for tools like Midjourney and Runway. One of its most recent updates saw the inclusion of image tools like Stable Diffusion and video generators like Runway. Poe even lets you create your own bot. Pricing: Poe has plenty of free options and a relatively generous monthly allowance for using the more advanced models. The base plan is $20 a month with access to advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic and others. One to watch: DeepSeek (Image credit: Pexels / Flux / NPowell) DeepSeek, a Chinese startup and major AI competitor to ChatGPT, has rapidly emerged as a formidable player in the AI landscape. Backed by the hedge fund High-Flyer, DeepSeek, founded in 2023, focuses on developing open-source large language models (LLMs) that rival or surpass existing industry leaders in both performance and cost-efficiency. Established by Liang Wenfeng, who also co-founded High-Flyer, DeepSeek is headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. The company's mission centers on advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) through open-source research and development. This approach aims to democratize AI technology, making it accessible for both commercial and academic applications. Currently ranking as the top free app on Apple's App Store, the platform is commited to open-source. Unlike many AI firms that offer subscription-based models, DeepSeek has fully open-sourced its models under the MIT license, allowing for unrestricted commercial and academic use. This commitment to openness contrasts with the proprietary approaches of some competitors and has been instrumental in its rapid rise in popularity. Notable AI models DeepSeek has introduced several groundbreaking models since the company s first launch including DeepSeek-V3. This model boasts 671 billion parameters and was trained on a dataset of 14.8 trillion tokens over approximately 55 days, costing around $5.58 million. Benchmark tests indicate that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5, while matching the capabilities of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Its architecture employs a mixture of experts with a Multi-head Latent Attention Transformer, containing 256 routed experts and one shared expert, activating 37 billion parameters per token. The latest model, DeepSeek-R1, released in January 2025, focuses on logical inference, mathematical reasoning, and real-time problem-solving. It was trained using reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning, employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning capabilities. This model achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 across various tasks, including mathematics and coding. One of DeepSeek's most significant contributions is demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed with substantially lower costs and resources. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 was trained using approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 chips, a stark contrast to the 16,000 chips typically utilized by competitors. This efficiency has prompted a reevaluation of the massive investments in AI infrastructure by leading tech companies. Pricing: DeepSeek is completely free but registration might be limited due to the current popularity of the platform.
