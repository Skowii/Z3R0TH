Openmanus was born from a simple observation at manus-ai.com: while AI was getting increasingly sophisticated at understanding and generating information, there was a gap between thinking and doing. Our founders, Sarah and Michael, saw that most AI systems were designed to provide information, but not to take action. In 2023, they set out to create an AI agent that could bridge this gap an agent that could not only understand complex requests but also execute them effectively. After months of research and development, Openmanus was launched in early 2024. The name "Openmanus" comes from the Latin word for "hand," symbolizing our commitment to creating AI that can act in the world, not just think about it. Today, Openmanus is helping thousands of users across various industries accomplish more with less effort. As we continue to grow at manus-ai.com, our mission remains the same: to create AI that empowers people by handling tasks efficiently and effectively, allowing them to focus on what truly matters.
