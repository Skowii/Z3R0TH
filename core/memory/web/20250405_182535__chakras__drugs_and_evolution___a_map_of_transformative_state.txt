In this ground-breaking book, Gregor Maehle shows how the chakras offer a blueprint for the natural evolution of life via single-cell organisms, reptiles, mammals and humans. He draws on his experiences with mind-altering plant agents and chemicals during the late 70's and early 80's, as well as extensive research, to objectively describe how drugs influence each chakra, including their potential but also spiritual setbacks and dangers. The author further explores whether psychoactive substances are a useful supplement, shortcut or accelerator of spiritual evolution. The book culminates in a complete map of transformative and mystical states, including their potential accessibility through psychedelics versus traditional yogic methods. Have you ever wondered how the feeling of pure love for another is connected to divine love? Have you ever asked yourself how the experience of pure consciousness is connected to that of an indigenous shaman? Have you ever been confused by the fact that the spiritual experiences of Buddha, Jesus, Krishna or Moses led to such different traditions? Gregor discusses how natural and spiritual evolution are interlinked and how experiences of divine revelation, cosmic consciousness and shamanistic trances are interlinked. Concluding, the author shows how yogic methods can help lift humanity out of its current destructive tendency, risking its own demise via ecocide, environmental holocaust and the 6th mass extinction of life. With yogic methods we can not only safely and effectively arrive at the same states accessible through psychedelics, but can also use them to integrate both negative and positive drug experiences.
