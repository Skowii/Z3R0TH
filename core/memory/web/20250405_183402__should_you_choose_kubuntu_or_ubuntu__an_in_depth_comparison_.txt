If you re looking to dip your toes into the Linux waters, two of the most popular and user-friendly distributions are Kubuntu and Ubuntu. But as a Linux newbie, how do you decide between these two options? Don t worry, we ll walk you through a friendly beginner-focused tour of how Kubuntu and Ubuntu compare. Read on to demystify the differences and decide which open source OS is right for you! What Are Distributions and How Are They Different? First, let s quickly cover what a "distribution" or "distro" is. The Linux operating system itself is just a kernel, which handles core functions like managing hardware resources and scheduling processes. Distributions take that Linux kernel and combine it with other software like: A desktop environment that controls the look, feel, and access to apps System tools like file managers, settings panels, package managers Default applications for web browsing, email, gaming, office work, etc. Different distros make different choices about which desktop environment to use, which apps to bundle, what versions to package, how to configure things, and more. This lets them optimize for particular uses or preferences. For example, Ubuntu aims for beginner-friendliness while Arch Linux appeals more to advanced users. The organization behind the distro also affects things like release schedule, long term support duration, pricing/funding model, and community resources available. Now let s see how two of the most popular distros, Kubuntu and Ubuntu, compare. Kubuntu and Ubuntu   What s the Difference? Ubuntu is the baseline distro produced by Canonical, which uses the GNOME desktop environment. Kubuntu is an officially recognized variant of Ubuntu that swaps out GNOME for KDE Plasma. Let s break that down: Kubuntu Kubuntu utilizes the KDE Plasma desktop environment and applications built with the Qt toolkit. It s designed to provide familiarity for Windows converts, with a classic taskbar/start menu layout and polished look. Kubuntu includes many apps from the KDE ecosystem like: Konsole   terminal   terminal Dolphin   file manager   file manager Gwenview   image viewer   image viewer Okular   document viewer   document viewer Kontact   personal information manager The latest Long Term Support (LTS) release is Kubuntu 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish", supported until 2027. Kubuntu is community-developed with lead sponsorship from Blue Systems. It releases new versions in sync with Ubuntu. Ubuntu Canonical s standard Ubuntu distro showcases the GNOME desktop environment and GTK toolkit. The focus is on simplicity and ease of use. Default apps include: Files   file manager   file manager Totem   media player   media player Evince   document viewer   document viewer GNOME Photos   image viewer   image viewer GNOME Calendar   calendar app Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish" is the current LTS edition, also supported through 2027. Canonical and the Ubuntu community drive development. Now that we ve introduced Kubuntu and Ubuntu, let s do a deep dive on how they compare. Comparing the Desktop Environments The choice of desktop environment is a key difference between the distros. Let s break down how KDE Plasma (used in Kubuntu) and GNOME (used in Ubuntu) stack up. Customization and Flexibility KDE Plasma is exceptionally customizable, enabling Linux power users to fine tune details like: Themes/color schemes Icons Effects like transparency, animations Widgets and desktop plugins Panel layouts Window behaviors It offers an insane amount of flexibility to mold a personalized desktop flow. GNOME conversely prioritizes simplicity and getting out of the user s way. Customization is intentionally more limited, but settings are streamlined for ease of use. Those accustomed to tweaking every pixel may find GNOME frustrating. Look and Feel KDE Plasma has a traditional desktop metaphor approach, with a customizable panel, application menu/launcher, system tray, and virtual desktops. This provides a familiar experience for those coming from Windows 7/10. GNOME uses a more mobile-inspired layout, optimized for touchscreens. Default settings have no typical panel or system tray. A dock shows open and favorite apps. A top bar provides access to notifications, settings, and the Activities overview. The emphasis is on clean and distraction-free. Applications KDE apps are built with the Qt toolkit, so they offer tight integration but a different style from GNOME s GTK toolkit apps. For example, Kubuntu s Dolphin file manager functions differently than Ubuntu s Files manager. So learning curve differs across the ecosystems. Both ship with abundant pre-installed programs for most everyday tasks. But Kubuntu tilts more to the KDE suite like KMail and Amarok, while Ubuntu defaults to GNOME apps like Evolution and Rhythmbox. Package repositories provide thousands more apps. Resource Use GNOME is generally less resource intensive than the featurerich KDE Plasma. Kubuntu requires a bit more system memory and GPU power for smooth performance. Lighter-weight hardware may fare better with Ubuntu. But modern PCs should capably run either. Verdict For those desiring personalization and control, KDE is hard to beat. But users wanting a fuss-free experience may appreciate GNOME s approach more. Ultimately both environments are highly capable, so it comes down to personal preference around workflow and style. Now let s compare some other key factors between Kubuntu and Ubuntu. Installation and Hardware Support Kubuntu and Ubuntu both use Debian-based .deb packages and the APT package manager. This makes software installation and management very similar. For new users, Ubuntu s Snappy also provides a simplified method of installing/removing apps. The installation process is the same   you can use a Live USB, set up a virtual machine, or dual boot. The only difference is selecting Kubuntu vs Ubuntu at boot. 20 GB of drive space is recommended for installation. Both also leverage the same upstream Linux kernel, so hardware compatibility is essentially equivalent. The vast majority of PCs and laptops will fully support Kubuntu or Ubuntu out of the box, no driver wrangling required! The collections of pre-installed software vary, but thousands more apps, tools, and utilities can be installed from the repositories. With some lightweight tweaks, either distro can work well even on older or lower-powered hardware. Ease of Use For brand new Linux users, Ubuntu generally has a gentler initial learning curve. The pared down GNOME interface helps users get up and running quickly without much complexity. Kubuntu s greater customization options via KDE Plasma may seem daunting at first. However, for intermediate and advanced users willing to climb the learning curve, Kubuntu can provide a more tailored experience. Power users often appreciate the ability to dial in their desktop s look, feel, and behavior. Ubuntu s software center does make discovering and installing apps simple for beginners. For those with some technical skill willing to learn, both distros can be molded into very friendly and usable systems. It mainly comes down to how much complexity you want on initial setup. Performance and Stability Both distros leverage the same Linux kernel and core components, so general performance is quite similar. Boot times are snappy on most modern hardware. In terms of benchmarks, Ubuntu may have a slight edge on things like game FPS due to lower overhead from the GNOME desktop. But benchmarks vary greatly based on full system specs. For less powerful PCs, Ubuntu s lower resource demands compared to KDE Plasma can translate to noticeably better speed and smoothness. Systems with 4 GB of RAM or powerful GPUs should handle either distro well. Stability is rock-solid on both thanks to the shared LTS kernel foundation. The vast repositories offer long-supported software versions, minimizing bugs. Crashes are extremely rare for everyday desktop use. So you can count on either distro as a reliable daily driver. Community Support and Documentation With a long history and commercial backing from Canonical, Ubuntu boasts one of the largest Linux communities. Documentation is extremely thorough with a treasure trove of advice for newbies and veterans alike. The Ubuntu Wiki and forums represent invaluable reference resources. As an official Ubuntu flavor, Kubuntu users can tap into much of these same community assets. But the Kubuntu-specific community is smaller, so information isn t always 1:1 applicable. Some features, tools, or workflows will differ. But KDE and Qt also provide their own extensive documentation. The smaller Kubuntu community is still very inviting for beginners needing help. But due to size, deep technical troubleshooting discussions may be less active than the bustling Ubuntu forums. So support availability can depend on the complexity of your issue. Customizing Each Distro One major advantage of open source freedom is the ability to customize distros to suit your style. Here are a few beginner-friendly customizations to try with Ubuntu and Kubuntu: Ubuntu Desktop Customization While GNOME offers limited theming, you can still tweak a few aspects: Search for "Background" and pick your preferred wallpaper Right-click the dock and select "Display on Left/Right" to move dock position Search for "Extensions" and enable/disable options like "Places Status Indicator" or "Dash to Dock" Search for "Startup Applications" and choose which apps launch on login Kubuntu Desktop Customization KDE Plasma is extremely flexible   here are just some basic ways to tailor your desktop: Right-click the panel and select "Configure Panel" then adjust position, size, widgets Click the cashew icon on the desktop to add widgets like system monitor graphs, stickynotes, folder view, etc Right click the desktop and select "Configure Desktop " to change wallpaper, icon theme, and more Search for "System Settings" and explore options for customizing almost any element Don t be afraid to tweak settings to make either desktop truly your own! Proprietary Software Support Neither Kubuntu nor Ubuntu ship with proprietary media codecs or drivers out of the box. But adding support for restricted content is easy: Open the terminal Run sudo apt install kubuntu-restricted-extras (Kubuntu) or sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras (Ubuntu) This will enable playback for MP3, AAC, etc. audio files and decoding for videos. Popular media apps like VLC will now work smoothly for local media playback. For Microsoft Office compatibility, install OnlyOffice or LibreOffice. Online services like Google Docs work perfectly in the web browser. Gaming compatibility varies but Steam Play via Proton allows many Windows games to run well. Check ProtonDB for game-specific reports. Overall, while not 100% seamless, common proprietary software and media generally works adequately on either distro. For business use, proprietary apps are best run in virtualization. Use Case Recommendations With so many similarities and tradeoffs, which distro is ultimately better for whom? Here are some general recommendations based on common user types: For new Linux converts , especially from Windows, Ubuntu offers the most gentle transition.
