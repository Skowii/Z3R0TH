There are enormous benefits to autonomous AI. These systems can do repetitive things so people can take up bigger problems. Autonomous AI can help businesses make their processes more productive by freeing up time for tasks like data analysis, decision making and the optimization of business processes, and this all without any need for 24/7 oversight from human beings. Autonomous AI is one of the most significant advantages of autonomous AI and it is capable of improving itself iteratively. Whereas traditional AI systems must be retrained almost constantly to stay effective, autonomous AI learns and reorganizes for new circumstances all on its own. It also allows this to become more accurate and efficient with time. Furthermore, autonomous AI systems are less likely to make human mistakes. According to David Duffett, 'AI systems can more reliably do tasks than people in industries like finance and healthcare which tend to be very precise.' One area where it could come into play is in healthcare, for example where autonomous AI can quickly work through huge quantities of data, analysing it to produce faster and more accurate insights than a doctor alone.
