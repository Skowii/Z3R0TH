C/C++ Programming for Beginners Basic to Advance Contents : Visit here for full course > Click the drop-down to view the outline C++ Advance (GUI) Visit here for full course C Advance (GUI) Visit here for full course What is C++ Programming Language ? C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. It is developed at AT and T's Bell Lab (USA) in 1979 The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. C++ is fun and easy to learn! As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa. Application of C++ Developing Games Operating Syatems Compilers and Editors Database Systems and Interpreters Graphics Packages Network Drivers C++ compiler /IDE To start using C++, you need two things: A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code. Popular IDE's include: Code::Blocks , Eclipse , and Visual Studio Code . These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code. I will be using Visual Studio Code in this Project, which I believe is a good place to start. You can find the latest version of VSCode at https://code.visualstudio.com/. Follow this process to install and setup VSCode , which will install the text editor with a compiler. Quick Start : Let's create our first C++ file. Open VSCode and go to File > New Text File. and go to File > New Text File. Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as): // myfirstprogram.cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { cout << "Hello World!"; return 0; } In VSCode, it should look like this: Then, go to Run > Run to run (execute) the program. Congratulations! You have now written and executed your first C++ program. Introduction to C   What is C Programming Language ? C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system. Both C/C++ has the same features and applications NOTE C and C++ uses the same compiler and IDE Quick Start : Let's create our first C file. Open VSCode and go to File > New Text File. and go to File > New Text File. Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as): // myfirstprogram.c #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf("Hello World!"); return 0; } C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.
