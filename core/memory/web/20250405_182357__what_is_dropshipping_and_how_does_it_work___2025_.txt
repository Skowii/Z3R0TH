Dropshipping is an easy way to start an online business, allowing you to sell a wide range of products without worrying about inventory, storage, or shipping. By partnering with suppliers, you can focus on marketing and customer service to grow your business. However, be prepared for challenges such as lower profit margins, inventory fluctuations, and potential shipping delays. Dropshipping is ideal for those who are skilled in marketing and comfortable handling customer support; it provides a low-cost, flexible solution to test and scale your business in the competitive ecommerce landscape. Dropshipping is a simple, popular way to start a business. It removes common retail challenges such as buying, storing, and shipping inventory. When a store using dropshipping makes a sale, it forwards the order to a supplier, who handles delivery to the customer. This lets store owners focus on other tasks, like marketing and branding. Ahead, learn what dropshipping is, how it works, and how to start dropshipping today. What is dropshipping? Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where online stores sell products without keeping them in stock. When a customer places an order, the store forwards it to a dropshipping supplier who ships the product to the customer. Dropshipping is an efficient order fulfillment model with low overhead but comes with trade-offs, such as reduced control over the customer experience. Many businesses prefer dropshipping because it removes costs like warehouse storage and unsold inventory. It s estimated that dropshipping generates more than $370 billion in ecommerce sales every year. What are dropshipping suppliers? Dropshipping suppliers fulfill orders made by retailers on behalf of customers. They produce or source products, store them, package them for shipping, and organize delivery to the customer address. You might work with an individual supplier or a platform that hosts a directory of suppliers, such as AliExpress. Some manufacturers, wholesalers, and independent makers also offer dropshipping services. What is a seller of record? A seller of record is the person or business that sells a product to the customer. As a seller of record, you re responsible for setting prices, collecting payment including taxes, and complying with local laws. In dropshipping, the seller of record is the point of contact for customers. It s the seller s information, not the supplier s, that appears on packaging slips and invoices. The seller also handles any support requests such as returns and refunds. Let s say you use dropshipping, and a customer buys a cat collar from your online pet store. As the seller of record, you forward the order to your supplier, who keeps the product in stock. The dropshipping supplier receives the order, packages the cat collar with a slip containing your information, and ships it to the customer.

After signing an agreement, they ll handle storage, packaging, and shipping of customer purchases. You could partner with an individual business in your niche. You can also use a dropshipping app to sell products from multiple suppliers. 2. Set up an online store Next, create your online store. Your store lists products from your supplier for a price that you decide. Add a dropshipping app to your store to keep product listings updated and automatically forward orders to suppliers: Collective lets eligible Shopify merchants sell products from top Shopify brands. DSers connects Shopify stores to AliExpress. Zendrop has a catalog with more than a million products. Spocket includes dropshipping suppliers in the US, Europe, Brazil, and India. AutoDS uses AI to help you find and import popular products to your store. 3. Receive a customer order When a customer visits your store and places an order, the checkout process happens as normal.

If you re using a dropshipping app, this step is automated. 5. Supplier prepares and ships the product The dropshipping supplier prepares the order and ships it directly to the customer. Many suppliers offer branded invoices and custom packaging to enhance the unboxing experience. 6. Customer receives the product The customer receives their product from the supplier while the store handles any customer service needs. Should you start dropshipping? Trying to decide whether dropshipping is worth it for you? Here are some signs that a dropshipping business model could fit your business: You re all about marketing If you re skilled in search engine optimization or social media marketing, dropshipping could be a great fit. The primary goal of dropshippers is to drive traffic to an online store, often using platforms such as Google, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. Many store owners leverage content marketing and an understanding of ranking algorithms to connect potential customers with products. You re sales-driven, not brand-focused If your business strategy is focused on generating high sales volume, dropshipping could be suitable for you. In other retail models, sellers add branding to their products, packaging, and communications to create a consistent brand experience, building customer loyalty. Dropshipping offers fewer branding opportunities. Packaging and delivery leave little room for personalization, and dropshipping products are rarely exclusive to a single retailer. This makes it harder to provide a unique experience that keeps customers coming back. If you re looking to sell branded products using dropshipping, explore options for private label dropshipping or print-on-demand products. You prioritize product variety Dropshipping gives merchants the ability to sell a wide array of products from a global network of suppliers without worrying about inventory. However, this comes with a trade-off: less control over product quality and consistency. Beyond ordering samples, you may have little influence over the manufacturing process. You re comfortable with longer shipping times In an era of super-fast delivery, most customers expect their purchases to arrive quickly. This presents a challenge for sellers who partner with overseas dropshipping suppliers. Products sent from international locations, such as China with ePacket, can take significantly longer to arrive, risking customer dissatisfaction. If you can source domestic suppliers or manage customer expectations around delivery times, dropshipping could be a viable option. You re prepared for customer support While dropshipping businesses don t deal with product fulfillment, they are the point of contact for customers. This means they often find themselves addressing customer service issues that are beyond their direct control, such as shipment delays, delivery problems, and product defects. If you re ready to navigate these challenges and manage customer inquiries effectively, dropshipping could be a well-suited business model. You re ready to grow Dropshipping isn t just for new stores. It s also a tool for established retailers looking to expand. By partnering with a supplier or another store that can handle fulfillment, retailers can add complementary products to their inventory without sourcing, purchasing, or stocking them. Offering customers a larger selection of products may increase your average order value. Using dropshipping to list additional products can also draw in new customers.

Learn more 7 benefits of dropshipping Here are seven reasons why dropshipping has become a popular ecommerce model for businesses: 1. Low costs Because you don t buy inventory, dropshipping requires minimal upfront investment. Many dropshipping stores are run from home with little more than a laptop, making it an attractive small business idea. With this benefit, however, comes competition from other dropshipping entrepreneurs. You ll need to invest your time rather than capital, applying tips from dropshipping experts to make your business work. 2. Wide selection of products to sell Use dropshipping to offer a wide array of trending products to your customers. With no unsold inventory to worry about, you can change your product catalog at will. If suppliers stock a new item, you can immediately list it for sale. 3. No product development costs Dropshippers also don t need to invest (and risk) capital in research and development to create a new product. Instead, they can source proven bestsellers that are ready to ship. 4. Flexible location A dropshipping business can be run from just about anywhere with an internet connection. As long as you can communicate with suppliers and provide timely customer support, there are few restrictions on where you live and work. 5. Easier to start Dropshipping removes many retail hurdles. Running an ecommerce business becomes easier when you don t have to: Manage or pay for a warehouse Monitor inventory Pack and ship orders Track inventory for accounting Handle inbound return shipments That said, successful dropshippers carefully oversee the fulfillment process and are committed to providing a satisfying customer experience. 6. Easier to test Dropshipping is a useful fulfillment model for testing customer interest in a new product category. Stores can trial sales of a dropshipped product before committing to buying inventory. 7. Easier to scale Scaling a traditional retail business takes forward planning. If a large number of orders arrive unexpectedly, it can be challenging to accommodate them, and you may quickly sell out of your inventory. Dropshipping businesses tend to scale more efficiently. Plus, you can expand your reach by dropshipping on popular marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy.

Listen now Dropshipping drawbacks Like all retail models, dropshipping also has its downsides. Here are three drawbacks to consider: 1. Lower profit margins The accessibility of dropshipping can lead to intense competition, resulting in lower profit margins as businesses undercut each other. The more you reduce prices, the harder it becomes to calculate profit margins that work for your store. Mitigate this problem by choosing the right products and selecting a dropshipping niche that s not over-saturated. 2. Inventory volatility For all its inventory management benefits, dropshipping exposes retailers to sudden changes in product availability. With suppliers fulfilling orders for multiple retailers, inventory levels can fluctuate unexpectedly something that s less of an issue when you stock your own products. Fortunately, many dropshipping apps give merchants options when a supplier s stock hits zero. For example, you could automatically remove a sold-out product or set a  Sold Out  label. 3. Shipping complexities Working with multiple suppliers can complicate order fulfillment. If a customer orders three items from three different suppliers, you ll need to calculate separate shipping costs and taxes for each. The items may also arrive at different times. For dropshippers sourcing products from international suppliers, cross-border shipping can introduce additional complexity, making issues harder to resolve when things go wrong. One possible solution is to pass shipping costs and import taxes on to customers. However, this may make your pricing less competitive.
