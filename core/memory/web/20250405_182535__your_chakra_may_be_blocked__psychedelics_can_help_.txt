Your Chakra May Be Blocked! Psychedelics Can Help. What can block your chakra, how to open all the 7 Chakras and activate the Avatar State Alexandre Porto   Follow Published in Cabbanis   7 min read   Jul 16, 2022 -- Share Chakra Integration   Illustration by Arianna Lusardi (https://www.instagram.com/jayaballard_/) My first LSD journey started a process of metamorphosis that I am now convinced will last forever. In the professional world of psychedelics, the process of personal change often triggered by a meaningful mystical journey is called integration. Only after I experienced the mystical dimension firsthand that I finally realized how narrow my ordinary view of the world is, The psychedelic perspective made it clear that there are spheres of existence that I m rarely aware of, but are ever-present. From that moment on, I consciously revisited past life events mentally trying to picture my memories through the psychedelic lens. To look into one s life through the psychedelic lens means to admit ignorance and accept that there are facets of life that are hidden from our awareness. It also means letting go of attachments to the Ego and truly looking deeply into who we are without judgment and without personal taboos. If you find the idea of Chakras intimidating or you have trouble having a good grasp on it, I can recommend Nickelodeon s show Avatar: The Last Airbender, which speaks a little about the chakras, what can block them, and how to release blocked chakras.
