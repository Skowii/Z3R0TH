The AutoGPT Platform is a system designed for creating AI agents to solve various business problems. It utilizes Docker Compose and provides the capability of running AI models, analyzing data, and generating insights in an automated manner. To set up the platform, you need Docker, Docker Compose V2, and Node.js & NPM. Once set up, it offers a frontend interface for managing tasks and monitoring the progress. You can also update and scale services using Docker Compose commands. Data persistence is achieved through the use of volume configurations in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
