Context and Problem Statement:
The problem statement is about the process of summarizing a knowledge that has been already solved into a brief form for memory storage. It focuses on creating a condensed version of the resolved issue along with its decision outcome.

Decision Drivers:
1. The need to store essential information in an easily accessible and compact format.
2. Enhance understanding and facilitate quicker retrieval of past decisions or knowledge.

Considered Options:
1. Option 1: Creating a short summary for each resolved issue, including the status, date, context, problem statement, decision drivers, considered options, and decision outcome.
2. Option 2: Providing only a brief abstract or main points of the previously solved issues without elaborating on context, considered options, and decision outcomes.

Decision Outcome:
The chosen option is "[option 1]", as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the issue, its resolution, and reasoning behind the choice. This option effectively allows users to grasp the entirety of a problem-solving process, which contributes to better knowledge retention and faster decision making in similar cases.
