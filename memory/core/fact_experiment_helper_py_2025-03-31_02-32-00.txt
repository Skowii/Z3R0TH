This code contains a collection of functions and classes related to natural language processing, grammars, and type systems. Some key functions are as follows:

- make_program_checker(dsl: DSL, examples): This function takes in a domain specific language (DSL), examples, and returns a checker that can verify if the programs generated by the model fit the examples.
- task_set2dataset(tasks, model, dsl: DSL): This function takes tasks, model, and DSL as inputs. It uses these inputs to generate datasets. Depending on what type of dataset is needed, there are two different functions for this step.
    - If the output dataset is a uniform PCFG (PCFG stands for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar), use 'task_set2dataset' function.
    - If the output dataset is not a uniform PCFG but a regular PCFG, use 'task_set2dataset' function with 'Uniform' changed to None.
- filter_examples(examples, nb_arguments_max, max_list_size, lexicon, verbose=False): This function filters examples based on the given parameters such as maximum number of arguments and list size. It returns a filtered dataset.
- __get_type__(el) and __get_type_request(examples): These functions return types for elements in input datasets and example datasets respectively. They are used to build a type system that can be used in the grammar building process.
