"Hey! Thanks for reaching out, I'd be happy to help. To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Google account and create a project on the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the YouTube Data API for your project.
3. Create credentials for OAuth 2.0 Client IDs in the API library for your application (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.). You can find detailed instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/migration).
4. Download the GoogleAPI.json file from Google Developer Console and place it into your project folder.
5. Ensure you have a valid Instagram account and access to it, as this is required for content scraping. You will need to follow accounts you want to scrape videos from. 
6. Finally, install the necessary libraries using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Then run the script with the command `python3 botTuber.py`.

If you face any issues during setup or operation, please feel free to reach out. I'm more than happy to help! ðŸ˜Š"
