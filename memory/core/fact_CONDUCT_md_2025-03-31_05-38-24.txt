The Appium Code of Conduct is an important document that outlines the expectations for behavior within the Appium community. It emphasizes creating a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all members regardless of their background. Inappropriate behavior, such as spamming, making demeaning comments, or harassment, are not tolerated in any Appium venue. If an individual experiences or witnesses inappropriate behavior, they should contact one of the designated organizers to report the issue confidentially. The ultimate goal is to maintain a safe and productive environment where members can contribute positively to discussions about code and technology.
