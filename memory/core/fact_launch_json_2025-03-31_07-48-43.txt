This knowledge is about configuration settings for launching a frontend application and backend server in a development environment. The configurations are as follows:

1. Frontend: Server Side - Launches the Node Terminal using "yarn dev" command to run the server-side of the frontend application from the specified directory.
2. Frontend: Client Side - Launches Microsoft Edge browser with the URL "http://localhost:3000" to access the client side of the frontend application.
3. Frontend: Full Stack - Runs the Node Terminal using "yarn dev" command to start the server-side and then launches Microsoft Edge browser with the generated localhost URL.
4. Backend - Launches a Python debugger for the backend application located in the specified directory, with environment variables set from ".env" file.
5. Marketplace - Launches a Python debugger for the marketplace application using the same settings as the backend configuration.
6. Everything - Combines all configurations to start everything together, stopping all tasks when finished.
