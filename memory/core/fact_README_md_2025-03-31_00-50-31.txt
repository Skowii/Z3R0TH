To get started using DeepPavlov, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Install DeepPavlov by running `pip install deeppavlov`.
2. Choose a model from the available list of pre-trained models or create your own custom model. You can find all available models at [https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/models_and_pretraining/#available-models](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/models_and_pretraining/#available-models).
3. Install the necessary requirements by running `pip install -r deeppavlov/requirements.txt`. This may take some time, depending on your internet connection and machine specifications.
4. Once you have installed DeepPavlov and its dependencies, follow the documentation guides for each model to learn how to use it. You can find all documentation at [https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/).
5. If you have any questions or issues while using DeepPavlov, feel free to join our discussion forum at [https://github.com/deep-pavlov/deeppavlov/discussions](https://github.com/deep-pavlov/deeppavlov/discussions) or reach out to us via email at info@deeppavlov.ai.

Evaluate model through CLI is also possible:

```bash
python -m deeppavlov eval <config_path> [-d] [-i]
```

Train and evaluate can be done in one step using `-t` option:

```bash
python -m deeppavlov train_and_eval <config_path> [-d] [-i]
```

For more details, see [docs](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/quick_start.html#cli)

### Python

You can also use a model using Python API:

```python
from deeppavlov import Model

model = Model(config_path='<your config>')
```

To train a model:

```python
model.fit()
```

Evaluate a trained model:

```python
model.predict('test data')
```

Interact with the model (streaming input):

```python
model.interact(input_source='<your data source>')
```
