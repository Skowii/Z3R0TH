Overview: Creating an AI Agent as a Block in AutoGPT allows you to create reusable, modular AI agents that can be combined with other workflows or shared with others.

What are Agent Blocks?
- Pre-configured, reusable AI workflows in AutoGPT.
- Can accept specific inputs, process data using AI and traditional automation, produce defined outputs, and be easily reused in different contexts.

Creating the Base Agent:
1. Add an Input Block, AI Text Generator Block, and Output Block.
2. Connect components: input to prompt, AI text generator's response to output.
3. Name components: question for input block, answer for output block.
4. Save the agent with a descriptive name (e.g., "Weather Agent").

Converting to a Block:
1. Access the Block Menu and search or click on the desired agent tag.
2. Add the agent block to your workflow, save it with a new name if needed.

Testing the Agent Block:
1. Run the agent by entering a test question.
2. View results in the "Agent Outputs" section or under "View More."

Advanced Usage:
- Combine different agents for more complex workflows.
- Share and use other people's agent blocks to build your own automations.
