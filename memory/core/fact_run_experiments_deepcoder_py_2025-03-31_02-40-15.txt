This Python script loads a dataset from a JSON file, filters the tasks for a specific model, and creates a dataset object. The dataset is used to gather data for multiple algorithms, which are then written as results in a CSV file. The main modules used are experiment_helper, model_loader, run_experiment, deepcoder_dataset_loader, and torch.
