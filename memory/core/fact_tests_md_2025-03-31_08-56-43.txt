This is an example of a focused test for building agents. It tests that you can build an agent and then run it. The focus is on the process of building and running an agent.

# TAGS: updated when something changes in the UI instead of needing to be updated every time you write a new test.

To create a new page object, do the following:

1. Create a new folder called "pages" under the "tests" directory if it doesn't exist already.
2. Create a new file for your new page object in this folder.
3. Make sure the filename is related to the page you are testing (e.g., `home-page.ts`).
4. Export a class with a name that represents the page, and within it create methods for interacting with elements on the page.
5. Add locators to each method so that Playwright knows how to find the elements on the page.

```typescript
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { test, Page } from '@playwright/test';

class HomePage {
  constructor(private readonly page: Page) {}

  async clickOnElement() {
    const element = this.page.locator('#element-id');
    await element.click();
  }
}

export class HomePageTests extends Page {
  async testExample() {
    // Use your newly created page object to interact with the page and perform tests.
    const homePage = new HomePage(this);
    await homePage.clickOnElement();
    await expect(this.locator('#result-id')).toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

### Making a new Test File

To create a new test file, do the following:

1. Create a new folder called "tests" if it doesn't exist already in your project root directory.
2. Create a new file for your test inside this folder.
3. Make sure the filename is related to the page you are testing (e.g., `home-page-test.ts`).
4. Import the page object class and other necessary classes from playwright or your project.
5. Extend the `Page` class with your new test class, and create a new method for each test case.
6. Use the methods from your page object class in these test methods to perform interactions and assertions on the page.

```typescript
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { HomePage } from './pages/home-page';

class HomePageTests extends Page {
  @test('Test example')
  async testExample() {
    // Use your newly created page object to interact with the page and perform tests.
    const homePage = new HomePage(this);
    await homePage.clickOnElement();
    await expect(this.locator('#result-id')).toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

After writing your test, you can run it with the command `yarn test`.
