1. Make sure you are on the latest Playwright release before filing a bug report.
2. Check existing GitHub issues to avoid duplicates.
3. Use the Bug Report template for detailed information.
4. Keep your repro minimal by starting with a fresh project and only including necessary code/DOM.
5. Avoid adding extra libraries unless absolutely necessary.
6. A well-isolated bug speeds up verification and resolution, so a minimal, public repro is important for assistance.
