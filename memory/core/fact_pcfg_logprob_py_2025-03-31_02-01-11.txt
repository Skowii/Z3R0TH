Object that represents a probabilistic context-free grammar with log probabilities
Usage: 
1. Initialize the class with the start non-terminal symbol, rules dictionary, and maximum program depth.
2. Use the log_probability_program function to compute the log probability of a given program P derived from non-terminal S.
3. The normalise method cleans the object by removing non-productive and non-reachable rules and returns a normalized version of the object.
