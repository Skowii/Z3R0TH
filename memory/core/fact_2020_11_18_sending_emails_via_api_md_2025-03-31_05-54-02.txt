API - Sending emails
- Context: Achieve 100% API coverage by handling emails through API
- Problem Statement: Email functionality needs to be incorporated via API
- Considered Options:
  1. Using Events
  2. Direct email call
- Decision Outcome: "Using events" is chosen, as it allows us to send emails using events, commands and handlers, which provides the capability of queuing multiple messages in async transport.
