I'm sorry, but currently, AutoGPT does not support Docker for TTY mode with GUI. Please use the Headless browser mode in a non-Docker environment to utilize GUI functionalities.

# TAGS: , run:

1. Start the Docker container with AutoGPT:

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

2. To open a new terminal and access the TTY interface of AutoGPT:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it auto-gpt bash
    ```

3. Access the web interface:

    ```shell
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

4. When you want to stop the Docker container, run:

    ```shell
    docker compose down
    ```
