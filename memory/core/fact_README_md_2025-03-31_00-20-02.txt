Puppeteer is a JavaScript library that allows users to control Chrome or Firefox browsers through DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi, typically in headless mode. It provides a high-level API for testing and automation purposes. To install, use `npm i puppeteer` or `npm i puppeteer-core`. The example demonstrates launching a browser, navigating to a URL, setting viewport size, typing into search box, waiting and clicking on result links, locating text, and printing the title of the blog post.
