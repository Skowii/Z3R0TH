Fully Automated YouTube Channel: A project that scrapes content from Instagram, edits a compilation video, and uploads it to YouTube daily. The process involves downloading the Github repository, installing Python3 and required libraries, setting up a YouTube API project, configuring Instagram credentials, and running the main script. After authorization, the channel scrapes content and uploads videos regularly.
