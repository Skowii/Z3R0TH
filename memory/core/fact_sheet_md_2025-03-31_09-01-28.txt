Google Sheets Read is a block that retrieves data from a specified range within a Google Sheets spreadsheet using provided credentials. The block fetches the data and organizes it in rows and columns as output. It can be used to read real-time data from a shared document. On the other hand, Google Sheets Write is a block that writes data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet using authentication information. This block can be used for updating real-time inventory or marketing analytics data directly in a spreadsheet.
