# üõ†Ô∏è Commands

Commands are functions that can be called by the agent to interact with users or APIs and use tools. They are provided by components that implement the `CommandProvider` [‚öôÔ∏è Protocol](./protocols.md).

- `command` decorator: The easiest way to provide a command, using the decorator with parameters, names, and description.
- Yielding commands in `get_commands`: To make a command available to the agent, it must be yielded from the provider's `get_commands`.
- Creating Commands directly: If you don't want to use the decorator, create the Command object directly.
