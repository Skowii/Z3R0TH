The sylius/payum-bundle is a Symfony bundle that integrates Payum, an e-commerce payment system, with Symfony applications. It supports multiple payment methods and currencies. This package requires PHP 7.4 or 8.0 and other Sylius modules like core, currency, order-bundle, and payment-bundle for proper functioning. It also depends on the php-http/guzzle6-adapter for network communication. The bundle is maintained by a team that includes key contributors such as Paweł Jędrzejewski, Kotlyar Maksim, Sylius project, and community contributions.
