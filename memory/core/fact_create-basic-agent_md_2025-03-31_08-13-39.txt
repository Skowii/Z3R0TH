Title: Creating a Basic AI Agent with AutoGPT

Overview: This guide explains how to create a simple question-answer AI agent using AutoGPT's visual builder, which can be expanded into more complex agents.

Example Agents:
1. Q&A (with AI): Step-by-step instructions on setting up an AI-powered question and answer agent.
2. Calculator (without AI): A simple calculator agent that does not require an AI model for calculations, focusing on input blocks, a calculator block, and output blocks.

Components Required:
1. Input Block
2. AI Text Generator Block
3. Output Block
4. Calculator Block

Steps to Create an Agent:
1. Set up the basic structure: Add input, text generator (AI), or calculator block, and output blocks.
2. Connect components: Ensure all relevant connections are made between the blocks.
3. Configure block names.
4. Save the agent configuration.
5. Test the agent by entering inputs and observing the results in either "View More" or "Agent Outputs."

Tips:
- Always save your agent after making changes.
- Verify all connections are properly made before running.
- Use the "View More" option for detailed output information.
