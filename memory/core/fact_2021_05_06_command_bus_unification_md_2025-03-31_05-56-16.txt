Summary: The unification of buses in Sylius involves utilizing the `sylius.command_bus` for command dispatching and the `sylius.event_bus` for events. This approach takes into account the differences between command bus validation, transaction usage, and database flushing compared to event bus implementation. The current system uses 2 tags `messenger.message_handler`, supporting both `sylius.command_bus` and `sylius_default.bus`.
