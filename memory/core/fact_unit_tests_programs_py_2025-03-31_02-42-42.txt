Import logging and unittest libraries, use built-in functions such as sqrt() from math module, use scipy.stats' chisquare function. Import Type, PolymorphicType, PrimitiveType, Arrow, List, UnknownType, INT, BOOL, STRING from type_system package. Use Program, Function, Variable, BasicPrimitive, and New classes. Utilize evaluation_from_compressed(), reconstruct_from_compressed() functions to test programs' evaluations.

In TestSum class, test programs and types for equality. Then, use a DSL (DeepCoder) with predefined semantics and primitive types. Evaluate programs using the DSL, check if they return correct results. 

Test if evaluation_from_compressed works correctly against 20,000 random programs generated by a_star algorithm.
