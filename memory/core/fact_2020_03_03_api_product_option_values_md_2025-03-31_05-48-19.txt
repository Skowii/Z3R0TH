API - Product Option Value
In version 1.8.0 (?)
Related PRs: #11136, #11144, #11157

Description:
To cover all `ProductOption` related functionality provided by the Admin panel via API, we had to decide on how to handle the Product Option's values collection. The decision was made to always provide Product option values with their Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), as they can exist outside of the `ProductOption`. Values embedded together with translations in the `ProductOption` would result in a massive and unmanageable response.
