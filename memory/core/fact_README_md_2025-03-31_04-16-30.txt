To use GPT Engineer, you can follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: You need to install the gpt-engineer package first. For this, you'll need a terminal or command prompt. If you are using a Unix-like system such as Linux, MacOS, run this command in your terminal:
```sh
pip3 install gpt-engineer
```
For Windows users, you can use PowerShell or Git Bash.

2. **Setup API Key**: If you're using the OpenAI model, you need to set up an OpenAI API key by creating a .env file in your project directory. The format of this file should be:
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
Replace 'your-api-key-here' with the actual API key you get from OpenAI. If you want to use Azure OpenAI, create an environment variable called `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` and set it to a deployment name in your region. You can find the deployment names at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to-create-deployment

3. **Usage**: With everything set up, you can now use GPT Engineer. In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your input files are present and run the following command:
```sh
gpte <path_to_directory> [-o output_file] [-m model] [-p prompt] [-i image_directory] [-d debug] [-v verbose] [-h help]
```
For example, let's say you have a folder called 'prompt' that contains your input files (prompt and images), you want to output the result to a file named 'result.py', use the GPT-4 model, set a custom prompt and specify that there are images in the directory:
```sh
gpte prompt -o result.py -m gpt-4 -p "Generate a Python script that says hello to everyone." -i prompt/images
```

4. **Debugging**: If you ever encounter any issues, you can use the '-d debug' flag with your command to get more information and potentially find the cause of the problem.

5. **Help**: For a detailed list of options and arguments, run 'gpte --help'.

That's it! You have successfully set up GPT Engineer and can start generating code using your chosen model.
