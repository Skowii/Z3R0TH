The Ideogram Model block is an AI-powered image generation tool that creates custom images based on text prompts and various settings. It allows users to describe what they want in text and provides options such as different model versions, aspect ratios, and style preferences. This block takes a text prompt and several optional parameters as input, sends the request to the Ideogram API, and returns the image URL as output. It can also upscale the generated image for higher quality.
