Status: Current level to beat: level 1
Command: pytest -s tests/challenges/memory/test_memory_challenge_d.py --level=1

Description:
- The provided code is a unit test designed to validate an AI's ability to track events and beliefs of characters in a story involving moving objects, specifically marbles.
- It involves a series of events and the movements of different marbles with Sally, Anne, Bob, and Charlie as characters. 
- After processing these events, it is expected that the AI writes down the beliefs of each character about the locations of each marble in JSON format.
- The test runs for levels up to the maximum level that the AI has successfully beaten or up to a user-selected level.

Files:
- `instructions_1.txt`
- ...and so on till `instructions_n.txt`
- Expected Beliefs for each character at every level is given in JSON format. 

Objective: This test checks if an AI can accurately model and track the beliefs of different characters based on their knowledge of events, which is a critical aspect of understanding and generating human-like narratives.
