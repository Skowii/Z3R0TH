sphinxcontrib.redirects is a Sphinx extension that generates redirects for moved pages when using the HTML builder. It works by reading a file called "redirects" located in the source directory, and then creating a redirect for each line in the file. The format of the lines should be:

    from_path space to_path

where 'from_path' is the old path of the page (including .html suffix if applicable) and 'to_path' is the new path to redirect to (also including .html suffix if needed). If 'to_path' starts with http:// or https://, it is assumed to be an external URL. Otherwise, the file system is assumed and the path should be relative to the output directory, prefixed with ../ as many times as the number of levels in the original path.

The extension is only supported by the "html" builder. When using this extension, the redirects are created before the build process starts, so that any old pages linking to moved pages will be redirected correctly.
