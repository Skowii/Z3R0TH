Sphinx version 1.8.5 is used, with a dependency on Docutils below version 0.18 for compatibility. PyOpenSSL and the requests library are also needed, specifically the "security" feature of requests. Sphinx-copybutton is utilized to handle code block copying, while sphinx-php is obtained from its Git repository at https://github.com/fabpot/sphinx-php.
