Summary: This roadmap consists of several projects to improve Appium, a mobile testing tool. The primary areas are core projects like implementing WebDriver BiDi support in the Appium server and redeveloping automatically generated command docs. Driver/platform-specific projects include maintaining Android and iOS drivers and updating appium-ios-device. Client library updates involve Selenium compatibility client improvements, and Appium Inspector enhancements cover full web inspection support, record/playback functionality, locator analysis and comparison, a dark theme option, export/import of saved gestures and bulk export/import of saved sessions.
