## GitHub Merge Branch

### What it is
A block that merges a specified branch into another branch in a GitHub repository.

### What it does
This block merges a source branch into a target branch, effectively incorporating changes from the source branch into the target branch.

### How it works
The block connects to the GitHub API, retrieves the latest commits from both branches, and then merges the changes into the target branch.

### Inputs
| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Credentials | GitHub authentication credentials required to access the repository |
| Repository URL | The URL of the GitHub repository containing the branches to be merged |
| Target Branch | The name of the branch into which the changes from the source branch will be merged |
| Source Branch | The name of the branch containing the changes to merge into the target branch |

### Outputs
| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Status | A message indicating the success or failure of the branch merging operation |
| Error | Any error message if the merge process fails |

### Possible use case
A developer wants to combine changes from a feature branch into the main development branch before pushing updates to a shared repository.

# TAGS: ease, including its name and URL |
| Error | Any error message if the release listing process fails |

### Possible use case
A QA engineer wants to check all published releases for a project to identify which version is being used in an upcoming test or to verify if a new release has been deployed.
