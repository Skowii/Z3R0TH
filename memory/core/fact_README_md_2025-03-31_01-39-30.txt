2. **Developer Functions (`packs/developer_functions.py`):**
   - **Function Debugging:** Display function source code, inputs, and outputs.
   - **System Information:** Retrieve system information such as environment version and usage statistics.
   - **Log Management:** View logs for specific functions or filter logs by execution outcomes.
   - **Dashboard Configuration:** Adjust dashboard settings like theme color and language.

These pre-loaded functions provide a foundation for building more complex functions and applications. You can also create your own function packs to expand BabyAGI's capabilities further.



**Remember that you can find all the mentioned features in the repository, as well as a lot of extra documentation and detailed examples!**

# TAGS: . Here's an example:

```python
import babyagi
from babyagi import builtin_functions as bf

babyagi.load_function(bf.circle_area)
print(babyagi.circle_area(2))  # Output: 12.566370614359172
```

## Key Dependencies

Functions can depend on external secrets, such as API keys or tokens. You can set these dependencies using the `key_dependencies` parameter during registration or loading of functions. For example:

```python
import babyagi

@babyagi.register_function(key_dependencies=["openai_api_key"])
def openai_completion():
    ...
```

In this case, the `openai_api_key` must be set before calling the function:

```python
import babyagi
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

babyagi.set_key("openai_api_key", os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
print(babyagi.openai_completion())  # Output: Completes an OpenAI function using the provided API key.
```

## Execution Environment

BabyAGI offers a controlled execution environment with automatic logging capabilities and various debugging tools. You can access logs through the dashboard or by inspecting files in the `logs/` directory. The execution environment is designed to be easily extended and customized for specific use cases.

### Log

BabyAGI records all function executions, including input arguments, output values, dependencies, and execution time. To access logs in real-time:

1. Open the dashboard (`http://localhost:8080/dashboard`).
2. Navigate to the "Logs" tab.
3. Check the log for a specific function or search for logs containing specific keywords.

## Dashboard

The BabyAGI dashboard is designed as a centralized management and monitoring tool. It includes features like:

1. A list of all functions registered with BabyAGI, including dependencies and metadata.
2. The ability to load additional function packs or plugins using the "Load Function" button.
3. Real-time logs of executed functions, along with their input arguments, output values, execution time, and dependencies.
4. An option to reset all state and logs for debugging purposes.

## Pre-loaded Functions

BabyAGI comes pre-loaded with several useful functions:

1. `circle_area`: Calculates the area of a circle.
2. `world`: Returns "world".
3. `hello_world`: Returns "Hello world!".
4. `math`: Provides access to Python's built-in math functions and constants.
5. `openai_completion`: Uses an OpenAI API key to perform text completion tasks.
6. ...

For a complete list, see the `builtin_functions` module in the source code. You can easily add your own functions or plugins by using the function packs or loading them manually with `load_function`.

## Future/Draft Features

- Expand on the execution environment to support multiple processes, asynchronous function execution, and customizable resource management.
- Introduce a more sophisticated dependency management system, allowing users to version functions and manage dependencies across different versions of functions.
- Implement an AI training framework that can adapt and learn from executed functions.
