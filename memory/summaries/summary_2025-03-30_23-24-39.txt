This article explains Python slice assignment. It recaps basic syntax, the ability to change list length, and using steps in slice assignment. In the assignment, the left-hand side is sliced while the right-hand side determines what value is assigned. The left-hand side can also be given an empty slice, allowing for element insertion. Using a step value, elements can be replaced after each stride.
