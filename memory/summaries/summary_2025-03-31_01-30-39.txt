This text explains how to compose asynchronous functions in JavaScript using either left-to-right or right-to-left function composition. Both methods involve using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` and the spread operator along with `Promise.prototype.then()`. The main difference between the two is the order of operations: left-to-right executes functions from first to last, while right-to-left starts with the last function and moves backwards.
