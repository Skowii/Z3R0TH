The Game Loop pattern ensures smooth gameplay by continuously updating game state, processing inputs, and rendering in real-time. It facilitates a consistent performance across different hardware setups. In Java, the Game Loop can be implemented to handle input processing, status updates, rendering, AI, and other processes. An example using a simple `Bullet` class demonstrates the movement of bullets while focusing on their 1-dimensional position for simplicity.
