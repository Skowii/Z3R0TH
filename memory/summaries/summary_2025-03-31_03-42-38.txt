The BSTIterator is an implementation of the Iterator design pattern for Binary Search Trees. It assumes that nodes with smaller values are inserted to the left and larger values to the right of a current node. This iterator follows "In Order" tree traversal, returning nodes in this order: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14 for the given Binary Search Tree.

The trivial solution would be to construct a list during the BSTIterator's construction, traversing the entire tree and adding each node value. This requires O(n) runtime and extra space of O(n). A better approach is to maintain only the path to the next smallest node. During the constructor, you navigate to the next smallest node while pushing nodes onto a stack. Calling `next()` would return the top node from the stack, ensuring it has a right child to follow for future traversals.
