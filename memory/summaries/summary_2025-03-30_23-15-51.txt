Staggered animations create a more dynamic user experience, especially for lists. They involve animating elements with a slight delay between each, controlled by custom CSS properties and the `transition-delay` property. Transitions are used to animate opacity and transform properties, making elements appear and move into position. This example uses a checkbox toggle to trigger the animation.
