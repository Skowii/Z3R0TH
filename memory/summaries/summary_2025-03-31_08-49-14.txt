This code defines a class ArraySlice for reshaping data arrays. It also provides a WAVReader class for reading wave files and slicing them into channels. The WAVReader class has properties like stereo, frames, and channels, which can be decorated with the @reshape decorator to return different shapes based on input arguments. A method channels_sliced is also provided, taking start and end seconds as input, to slice wave data into specific time frames. Another method, channels_lazy, reads wave data in chunks.
