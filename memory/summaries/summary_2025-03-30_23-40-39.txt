Closures are often misunderstood but crucial for clean, maintainable code. They can lead to hidden state, causing bugs and unmaintainable code. However, there are valid cases where hidden state is expected and necessary. The remedy to hidden state issues is functional programming and refactoring state into arguments or global variables. Closures can also be used safely for accessing shared constants.
