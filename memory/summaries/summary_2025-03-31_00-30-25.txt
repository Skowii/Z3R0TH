Determining if two URLs are on the same origin involves checking if they have the same protocol, host, and port. Using JavaScript, you can compare their properties to find out if they are on the same origin or not. Example: `const isSameOrigin = (origin, destination) => origin.protocol === destination.protocol && origin.host === destination.host && origin.port === destination.port;`.
