The Throttling Pattern in Java is a design pattern used to manage resource usage in high-demand applications. It involves rate limiting, ensuring consistent performance and preventing system overload. The pattern is ideal for developers and software architects interested in optimizing resource management. By controlling the number of requests a system can process within a given time frame, Throttling Pattern helps maintain stability and ensure an ideal user experience. A programmatic example in Java demonstrates how to track the number of calls per customer and limit their access accordingly.
