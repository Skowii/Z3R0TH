Create a unit converter data structure in JavaScript that can convert between any compatible units. The data structure will store the value internally as centimeters and provide methods for converting from and to other units. Use `Object.defineProperty()` to create getters for each unit, which calculates the value in the specified unit. Additionally, create static methods for each unit that creates a new instance of the data structure with the value converted to the internally stored unit.

Alternatively, use a factory function with prototypal inheritance to create a generic unit converter data structure for any type of measurement. Create a single factory function that can be used to create a unit converter for various measurements.
