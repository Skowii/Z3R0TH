Split an array into chunks by either specifying a desired number of chunks or a size for each chunk. To split based on the number of chunks, calculate the size needed to divide the array evenly and use `Array.from()` with a mapping function that slices elements into chunks. To split based on size, first determine the number of chunks required and then follow the same process as above. For more control over dangling elements in the last chunk, add a minimum chunk size parameter and adjust the calculation accordingly.
