The article explains how to create a JavaScript function that renders a DOM tree in a specified container using recursive creation and appending of DOM elements. It starts by describing the object structure used to represent the DOM tree similar to React's virtual DOM representation. The article then presents a function for rendering the DOM tree using destructuring and helper functions to identify text and element nodes, as well as handling attributes and event listeners. This approach is intended for demonstration purposes only, lacking features and optimizations present in React or Preact.
