The Balking Pattern in Java is a concurrency design pattern that prevents an object from executing certain code if it is in an inappropriate or incomplete state. This pattern is crucial for managing states and ensuring proper execution in multithreaded Java applications. A real-world example of this pattern can be seen in a laundry service, where a washing machine only starts when the door is properly closed and locked. Similarly, in software design, the Balking Pattern ensures that operations are executed only when the object is in an appropriate state. This prevents erroneous actions and maintains system stability. A programmatic example demonstrates the use of this pattern in a multithreaded Java application. The WashingMachine class has two states: ENABLED and WASHING, and it ensures that the wash operation is executed only when the object is in an appropriate state.
