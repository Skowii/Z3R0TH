The Dynamic Proxy Pattern in Java is a flexible runtime mechanism for creating proxies that enhance functionality and control access to objects. It dynamically creates proxies for various interfaces at runtime, allowing for controlled access or enhancement of objects. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios requiring the implementation of additional functionalities without modifying the original class code. Examples include unit testing with Mockito and implementing type-safe proxy objects. The Dynamic Proxy Pattern involves encoding method invocations to an instance's invocation handler, dispatched to another object through a uniform interface. This pattern can be used in Java by leveraging Reflection for accessing interfaces without explicitly implementing them.
