The Metadata Mapping Pattern in Java is a design pattern used to manage the mapping between database records and objects within Java applications. This pattern ensures that database schema and object model remain decoupled and maintainable. In real-world examples, such as online retail systems, this pattern allows for easy management of products with varying attributes. Hibernate ORM Tool uses Metadata Mapping Pattern to specify the mapping between classes and tables using XML or annotations in code, providing flexibility and adaptability in handling database updates and schema changes.
