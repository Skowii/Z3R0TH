In JavaScript, objects are mutable by default even when declared with `const`. To deep freeze an object to make it immutable, you can use the `Object.freeze()` method. However, this only provides a shallow freeze, meaning nested objects and arrays remain mutable. To achieve a deep freeze, recursively iterate through the object using `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()`. This will apply `Object.freeze()` to all properties, including nested objects and arrays, making the entire object immutable.
