The custom `useTimeout` hook simplifies using `setTimeout()` in a declarative manner within React components. It uses `useRef()` for the callback function, and `useEffect()` to manage the timeout setup and clean up upon component unmounting. The hook's implementation is similar to the `useInterval` hook and takes a callback function and delay as arguments.
