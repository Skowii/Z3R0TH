A JavaScript queue is a linear data structure that follows a first in, first out (FIFO) order of operations. It adds elements to the end and removes them from the start. The main operations are `enqueue` for adding an element, `dequeue` for removing one, `peek` for retrieving without removal, and `isEmpty` for checking if empty. A queue can be implemented using a class with a constructor initializing an array for each instance, followed by methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations.
