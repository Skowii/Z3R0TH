This information discusses the use of dynamic properties and maintaining robustness while ensuring type safety. The goal is to utilize the object-oriented concept in managing dynamic properties across multiple interfaces. In a real-world example, a car consists of many parts, but we don't know if all or only some parts are present. A dynamic programming pattern allows adding properties to objects without the object being aware of this addition.

The target is to achieve high cohesion between components in a strong typed language, allowing for adding new properties during the execution process without losing safety support for types. This concept uses interfaces and abstract classes to separate distinct properties for various interfaces. For instance, an abstract Document class is introduced as the basis with key-value properties, while extending this interface with specialized behaviors (HasType, HasPrice, HasModel, and HasParts) for specific scenarios, such as a car.
