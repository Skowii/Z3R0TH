JavaScript ES6 introduced spread and rest syntax, which are powerful features for working with arrays. The spread (`...`) operator allows you to expand a single array into its values, useful for cases like cloning, concatenating, flattening arrays, or converting iterable objects to arrays. The rest parameter syntax (e.g., `...nums`) captures any remaining arguments in a function declaration and collapses them into an array. These operators can simplify code and make it more readable.
