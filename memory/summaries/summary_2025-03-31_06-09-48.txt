The Collection Pipeline pattern is a functional programming approach that involves using functional composition and collection pipelines to chain together operations in a sequence. This pattern is commonly used in reactive programming, where multiple small modules are combined to form a cohesive and manageable flow of execution. In this pattern, data is collected into a stream and then processed by functions through a pipeline. Both functional composition and the collection pipeline patterns are often employed together in object-oriented programming, especially when working with many statements or loops.
