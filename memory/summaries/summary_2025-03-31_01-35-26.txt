A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of linked nodes with at most two children each. Nodes represent a tree structure, and the main operations include inserting, removing, finding, and traversing in pre-order, post-order, or in-order. The following properties are required for each node: key, value, parent (null if none), left child pointer, and right child pointer. A binary tree implementation can be achieved using a BinaryTree class with methods for insertion, traversal, and searching.
