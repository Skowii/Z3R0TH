The Page Object Pattern in Java creates a model for UI elements of web pages, simplifying test automation code and improving maintainability. In this pattern, each department serves as a single point of contact for the receptionist, similar to how a Page Object abstracts interactions with web elements from test scripts. This reduces duplicated code and allows for easier updates when the UI changes. The benefits include test maintenance enhancement and reduced code duplication, making it popular in test automation.
