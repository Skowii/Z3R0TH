Prime factorization is a crucial technique to find the prime factors of any number, commonly used in number theory. It consists of two steps: calculating all prime numbers up to a specific range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and reducing the given number with these prime numbers to find its factors. The complexity is approximately O(n log n). To compile, you need a C++ 11 compiler flag.
