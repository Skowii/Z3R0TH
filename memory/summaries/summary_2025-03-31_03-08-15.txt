The Singleton Pattern in Java ensures that a class only has one instance and provides global access to this single instance. This pattern is useful for coordinating actions across a system where exactly one object is needed. One common real-world example is a government issuing passports, as each citizen can only be issued one valid passport at a time. In Java, the Singleton Pattern can be implemented using an enum type, ensuring that only one object of a particular class is ever created. This pattern can be used when there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
