The benchmark was run for a total of 1089 seconds. Four tests were performed: TestWriteFile, TestPlanCreation, TestGoalDivergence, and TestSearch. TestWriteFile involved writing the capital of America to a .txt file with a success rate of 88.89%. TestPlanCreation asked the AI to create a plan for booking a flight to Toronto, which it accomplished successfully. TestGoalDivergence assessed the AI's ability to follow instructions by creating .txt files, but failed in this task. Finally, TestSearch tested whether the AI could search content, demonstrating success at a rate of 12.5%.
