This content is about an Information Retrieval Challenge with three levels: Current level, which needs to be beaten; Level 2; and Level 3. The goal for all levels is to find Tesla's revenue, but the search queries vary. The current level is to beat is Level 2, where it doesn't explicitly ask to search for 'tesla revenue 2022'. Level 3 asks for tesla's revenue by year since its creation and the result should be written in a file called output.txt. The objective of this challenge is to test the agent's ability to retrieve information consistently.
