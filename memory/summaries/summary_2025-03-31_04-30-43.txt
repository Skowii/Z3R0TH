The Step Builder is an extension of the Builder pattern that fully guides users in creating objects without any confusion, resulting in a much better user experience. Users only see the next step method until the appropriate time for the "build" method to be invoked. It is suitable when constructing algorithms need independence from part composition and assembly methods while maintaining order importance.
