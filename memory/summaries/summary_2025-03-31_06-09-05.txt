The Aggregator Microservices is an architectural approach that uses a centralized service (aggregator) to call multiple microservices. It collects data from different microservices and provides a unified response. For example, consider a web application that needs information about products and their inventories. An aggregator calls the Product Information microservice, which returns the product title and its inventory details, and then the Aggregator puts together the data for an overall summary. This is useful when there is a need to call multiple services for various tasks, reducing complexity and improving performance.
