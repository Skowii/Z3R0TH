The Sylius/Currency library is designed to handle currency management in PHP applications. It supports features such as cash, currency, money, and currencies. The library requires PHP versions 7.4 or 8.0 and uses the MIT license. Developed by Paweł Jędrzejewski, the Sylius project, and community contributors, it is available on https://sylius.com. It also depends on other libraries such as Symfony/Intl, Laminas/Laminas-Stdlib, and PhpSpec for development.
