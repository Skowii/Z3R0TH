Double Buffering is a technique used to improve performance and avoid flickering in games and animated images. It involves using multiple buffers, where one buffer is displayed while another stores the next frame to be shown. This makes animations appear more realistic compared to single-buffer systems. In computer science, double buffering refers to storing more than one data set in a memory, allowing a reader to view a complete version (even if outdated) rather than a partially updated version created by the writer. It is commonly used in image processing and video games. The example code shows an implementation of Buffer interface and a FrameBuffer class that implements this buffer interface.
