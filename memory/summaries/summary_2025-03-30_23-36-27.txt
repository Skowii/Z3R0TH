The sum of powers of numbers from start to end can be calculated using JavaScript array methods and the exponentiation operator (`**`). Using `Array.from()`, create an array of appropriate size and iterate over elements with `Array.prototype.reduce()`. Calculate the sum of each element's power by raising its index to the power, considering default values for start and power when omitted. For older browsers, use `Math.pow()` instead.
