Flux is a structural pattern that utilizes unidirectional data flow instead of MVC. It decouples views, actions, and stores, enabling efficient updating when users interact with a view. The central component communicates changes to the affected stores and reacts accordingly. This approach simplifies tracking updates during development and makes it easier to identify and fix errors. Flux is widely used for building user interfaces, as demonstrated by Facebook's implementation.
