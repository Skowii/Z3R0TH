The JavaScript `Array.prototype.slice()` method is a versatile tool for retrieving elements from an array between two indices. It can be used to get the first or last n elements of an array. For the first n elements, use start value 0 and end value n; for the last n elements, use start value -n and no end value. Examples include `firstN(arr)` for the first element, `firstN(arr, 2)` for the first two elements, `lastN(arr)` for the last element, `lastN(arr, 2)` for the last two elements, and `lastN(arr, 5)` for the last five elements. This method handles out-of-bounds indices and produces a shallow clone of the original array, but be cautious with negative n values as the results may not make sense.
