JavaScript can be used to smoothly scroll to the top of a web page. To achieve this, first determine the distance to the top using Document.documentElement or Document.body and Element.scrollTop. Then, scroll by a fraction of the distance from the top while ensuring the distance is greater than zero. Animate the scrolling using Window.requestAnimationFrame() for efficient optimization. However, be aware of potential accessibility concerns and provide options to disable smooth scrolling.
