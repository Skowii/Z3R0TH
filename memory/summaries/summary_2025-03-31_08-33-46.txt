The Creative Commons Legal Code CC0 1.0 Universal is a public license that allows creators to permanently relinquish their exclusive rights to a work, contributing it to a commons for the public to build upon, modify, reuse, and redistribute as desired. This license aims to promote a free culture and further production of creative works without fear of later claims of infringement. The person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer") voluntarily elects to apply CC0, distributing the Work under its terms with knowledge of their copyright and related rights in the Work and the intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. Copyright and Related Rights may include reproduction, adaptation, distribution, performance, display, communication, translation, moral rights, publicity and privacy rights, unfair competition protection, data extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data, and database rights.
