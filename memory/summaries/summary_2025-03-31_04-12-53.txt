Composite Entity pattern is used to model, describe, and manage a group of related persistent objects instead of treating them as individual entities. It simplifies managing interrelated objects using a single unified object. This pattern is useful when managing multiple dependent objects in a system. It can be applied in scenarios where one wants to control several objects through a single object, thus adjusting the granularity of these objects and managing their lifecycles within the coarse-grained composite entity object.
