This code contains two sets of tests - one for arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) and another for statistical operations (mean, median, and mode). The arithmetic test cases cover various input values and error conditions. Statistical operations are tested with different numbers of odd or even elements, unsorted lists, single mode inputs, and multiple mode inputs.
