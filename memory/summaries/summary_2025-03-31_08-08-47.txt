The Trampoline Pattern in Java is a design pattern used to manage recursive function calls efficiently and prevent stack overflow errors. It converts recursive functions into iterative loops for better performance and safety. The real-world example compares it with relay race where batons are passed directly from one runner to the next, avoiding backtracking. This pattern can be implemented in Java by using a Trampoline interface that returns a Trampoline object when get() is called. When get() is invoked again on the returned Trampoline, it iteratively calls jump() on the result until it reaches a done() function which returns the final value.
