Builder is a creational design pattern that separates the object creation process from its usage to allow for more flexibility and easier maintenance of code. It allows different builders to create the same object in various ways, making it useful when multiple representations of an object are needed. This pattern involves creating a separate object builder class with a fluent interface, allowing properties to be set step-by-step rather than in one go. The builder class then uses these settings to instantiate the final object.
