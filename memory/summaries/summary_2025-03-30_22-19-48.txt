The given information describes a process that uses the CMake RELATIVE flag for listing source files, creating executables and setting target properties. This script creates an executable from each .cpp file in the current directory, and uses string replaces to obtain their names. It then links these executables with OpenMP libraries if they're found, and installs them under a "bin/others" destination.
