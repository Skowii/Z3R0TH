The clearfix hack eliminates the need for non-semantic markup to clear floats in layouts, resolving issues with elements not clearing their floated children. To apply this technique, create a pseudo-element with `content: ''` and apply `clear: both` to it. Ensure there are no non-floating children or tall floats before the container in the same formatting context. Modern alternatives like flexbox or grid layout are recommended over using float for building layouts.
