Clamping and mapping a number to a range are two common operations in JavaScript. To clamp a number, use `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` to find the closest value within a specified range. For safe integers, use `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`, along with `Math.round()`. Mapping a number to a range involves a linear transformation by finding the ratio between the original and target range limits.
