CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern in Java that separates commands, which modify the state of an application, from queries, which read the current state. This separation enhances scalability, performance, and maintainability of complex software systems. It's like having different teams handle book borrowing and returning tasks at the front desk, separate from searching and reading in a library. This ensures each task is optimized for efficiency and user experience. CQRS can be implemented by separating read and write operations into different services, as seen in this Java example, which uses CommandService to create authors and books independently.
