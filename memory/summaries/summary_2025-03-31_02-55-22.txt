Incorporate the following SEO tips for developers:

1. Craft user-friendly URLs and map them appropriately: Use human-readable URL slugs separated by dashes, match them to your website's structure, build a sitemap, and redirect broken or old URLs.
2. Use structured data to help Google understand your pages: Set up the appropriate structured data type for your pages to appear in featured snippets and improve search rankings.
3. Set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console: Track user behavior and gather data with Google Analytics, while identifying user searches with Google Search Console.
4. Keep an eye on markup, performance, and accessibility: Optimize your code with semantic markup, fast load times, device compatibility, and accessibility for all users, regularly auditing with tools like Lighthouse.
