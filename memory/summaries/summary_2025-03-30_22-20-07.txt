This script uses the RELATIVE flag to create a list of source files (APP_SOURCES) in the current directory. It then iterates through each file, generating an executable with the same name as the file and setting target properties such as linker language. If OpenMP_CXX is found, it links the target library. Finally, the executables are installed to the "bin/dynamic_programming" destination.
