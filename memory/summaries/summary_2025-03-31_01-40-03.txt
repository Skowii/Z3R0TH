Calculate Euclidean distance in JavaScript using Math.hypot(). The formula for calculating it is based on the hypotenuse of a right triangle following the Pythagorean theorem. For 2D, use `Math.hypot(x1 - x0, y1 - y0)` and for any number of dimensions (including 3D), map each coordinate's difference between two points using `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.map()`, and the spread operator to pass values to `Math.hypot()`. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of dimensions.
