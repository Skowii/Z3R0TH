Memory Challenge C aims to test an agent's ability to follow instructions and maintain memory of task IDs. The agent should read text files containing instructions and phrases, follow them, and write all the phrases into a file named output.txt. This challenge tests the agent's comprehension and retention skills as it progresses through multiple levels with increasingly complex instructions.
