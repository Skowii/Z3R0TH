Create a JavaScript promise that resolves after a given amount of time: 
- Use the `Promise()` constructor.
- Call the `resolve` function with the passed `value` using `setTimeout()`.
- Example: `const resolveAfter = (value, delay) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), delay));`
