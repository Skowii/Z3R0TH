Arrow functions are a useful tool for JavaScript developers to learn and master. They are syntactically different from regular functions, with various ways of writing them depending on the number of arguments and expressions involved. The main difference between arrow functions and regular ones lies in execution context (i.e., the value of `this`), which affects how constructors work. While a regular function's `this` is dynamic and depends on how the function was invoked, arrow functions don't define their own execution context. Instead, `this` inside an arrow function always refers to the lexical `this`. This makes arrow functions suitable for situations where it's important to maintain the same meaning of `this` throughout the code.
