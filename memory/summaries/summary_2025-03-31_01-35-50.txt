The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that can be implemented in JavaScript with a few lines of code. It works by replacing each letter with another fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The following implementation uses modulo, ternary, and spread operators to iterate over strings and encrypt or decrypt letters based on the shift value provided. However, note that the Caesar cipher is easy to break, so do not use it for sensitive data.
