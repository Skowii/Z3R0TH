To update a remote branch after rewriting Git history, follow these steps:
1. Ensure local and remote branches diverge due to history rewrite.
2. Force update the remote branch with `git push -f`.
3. Use `git checkout`, `git pull`, and `git rebase` as necessary.
4. Be aware of potential destructive consequences, especially for shared branches.
5. Ensure you have permissions to force update remote branches if required.
