To fix a previous commit in Git, create a "fixup commit" that can be autosquashed during the next rebase. Use `git commit --fixup <commit>` to create a fixup commit for the specified `<commit>`. After running `git rebase --autosquash`, the fixup commits will automatically squash into the commits they reference, keeping your commit history clean and organized. Create an alias using `git config --global alias.fix 'commit --fixup'` to simplify the process of creating a fixup commit. Additionally, install `fzf` to interactively select the commit hash from a list before creating the fixup commit.
