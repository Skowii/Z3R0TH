Validate an object's properties by checking them against an array of keys or another object to ensure they match. Use `Object.keys()` and built-in methods such as `Array.prototype.every()` and `Array.prototype.includes()`. Loosely check if the object keys exactly match, are a subset, or superset of the specified array. Alternatively, validate an object against another object by comparing their keys using `Object.keys()`.
