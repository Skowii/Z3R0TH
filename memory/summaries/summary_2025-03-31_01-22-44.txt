The text discusses how to check if a string starts or ends with a substring of another string using JavaScript. To do this, use the `String.prototype.startsWith()` and `String.prototype.endsWith()` methods respectively. For starting strings, iterate through the longest to shortest substrings and check against the given text. Return the longest matching substring or undefined if not found. For ending strings, do the opposite by iterating from shortest to longest substrings. The provided examples show how these functions work in practice.
