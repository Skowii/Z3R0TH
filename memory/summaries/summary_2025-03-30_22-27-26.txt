Tag input fields allow users to add multiple tags to a form or search field and can be implemented easily with React. The initial tags are stored in a state variable, and `Array.prototype.map()` is used to render the list of tags. The `addTagData` and `removeTagData` methods are called when pressing enter or clicking on the delete icon within the tag. A custom CSS style is applied for better presentation.
