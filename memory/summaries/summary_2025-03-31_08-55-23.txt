The ui file creates a window with a layout containing:
- A label for the current directory
- A read-only line edit for the current directory
- A push button to load files
- A horizontal splitter to separate two QWidgets:
  1. A vertical layout with a bold label and a srcFileList (source file list) QListWidget
  2. A vertical layout with a bold label and a dstFileList (destination file list) QListWidget
