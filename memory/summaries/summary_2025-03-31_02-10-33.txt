The delay in JavaScript's `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` functions is not exact but acts as a suggestion rather than a guarantee. The actual delay can be affected by various factors such as the state of the JavaScript engine, browser throttling of nested timeouts/intervals or those in background tabs, and tracking scripts in inactive tabs. Note that some browsers may have limits on delay storage as signed integers, causing overflows for delays over 24.8 days.
