To ensure your footer stays at the bottom of the page, use a combination of HTML and CSS. Two modern techniques are using Flexbox or Grid. For Flexbox, set `body` to `min-height: 100vh`, `display: flex`, and `flex-direction: column`. Add `margin-top: auto` to the footer element. For Grid, set `body` to `min-height: 100vh`, `display: grid`, and `grid-template-rows: 1fr auto`. Both methods are straightforward and flexible depending on your specific needs.
