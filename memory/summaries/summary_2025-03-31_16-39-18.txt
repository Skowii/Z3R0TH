This content discusses handling non-CRUD operations in APIs, which can be challenging when operations go beyond Create, Read, Update and Delete. Four considered options are presented: enriching resource data with possible operations using the PUT method; defining custom operations in the style of the command pattern using POST; and taking advantage of the 'Controller' REST archetype. The pros and cons for each option are discussed, considering factors such as maintaining consistency with conventions, clarity of execution expectations, HATEOAS support, and adding additional fields during operation execution.
