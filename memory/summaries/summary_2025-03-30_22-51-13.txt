Git allows you to set up a commit message template for consistency in your repository. You can use `git config commit.template <file>` to specify the file with the commit message format, which opens it in your text editor whenever you commit changes. This is useful if your team follows a specific format like Conventional Commits. To create a template, add a file named "commit-template" at the repository root and use it as the commit message template.
