Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is a programming pattern that allows derived types to inherit the behaviors of their base classes. It was first introduced in C++ and involves a class X inheriting an application of the base template using X as the argument for the template. This concept enables instances to have specific attributes and methods while sharing common functions with the base class.

The CRTP pattern has been applied in the given example to create a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters interface, where different types of fighters, such as Bantamweight or Heavyweight, can be created by extending the base fighter class with their specific weights. This ensures that fighters only compete against others from their same weight class, preventing mismatched battles between light and heavyweights.
