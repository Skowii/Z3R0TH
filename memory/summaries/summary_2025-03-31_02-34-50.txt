Numeric separators are a JavaScript feature that improves the readability of large, numeric constants. By adding underscores (_), one can easily understand the value of these constants. This is especially useful for shared constants with many repeated digits or ambiguous numbers. However, there are some limitations; numbers cannot start or end with a numeric separator and multiple separators are not allowed in a row.
