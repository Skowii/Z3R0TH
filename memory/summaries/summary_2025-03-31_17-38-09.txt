The AI agent performed tests with varying difficulty levels in the agbenchmark tool. In the test for writing to a file, the answer was Washington but the test failed due to an assert failure. The agent also attempted to create a two_sum function, which did not succeed as it depended on another failed test. A search-related task failed due to dependency on a different failed test. Similarly, a read-file related task failed due to dependency on yet another failed test. Finally, the agent was supposed to create a three_sum function but this test is still pending. The overall run time was 15.87 seconds and there were no successful tests.
