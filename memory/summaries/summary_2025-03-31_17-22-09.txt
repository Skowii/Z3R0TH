Unreal Text to Speech is a block that converts text into speech using the Unreal Speech API. It takes text input and generates an audio file with the specified voice selection. The block sends the text, voice ID, and API key to the API for processing, then outputs the MP3 URL for accessing or downloading the audio file. This block can be used in applications that assist visually impaired users by converting written content into audio format.
