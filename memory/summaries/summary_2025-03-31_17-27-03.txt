Components are essential building blocks for agents in Forge, offering additional functionalities or processing capabilities. They can be enabled, disabled, ordered, and can rely on each other. Components are detected via their type and can have custom configurations using pydantic BaseModel. Sensitive information can be handled through environment variables and exclusion settings during serialization. Agents can load configuration files for initializing components, ensuring an organized and customizable system.
