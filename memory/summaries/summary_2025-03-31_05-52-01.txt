The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It allows for the traversal of a container's elements without accessing expressions. In a treasure chest example, this means providing an iterator interface to access its items without directly interacting with the container itself. The iterator pattern is used in situations where multiple aggregate objects need to be accessed uniformly or when inner representation should not be exposed.
