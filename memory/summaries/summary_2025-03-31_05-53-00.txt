The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an algorithm family, encapsulates each algorithm into a separate class, and makes them interchangeable at runtime. This allows clients to use different algorithms without knowing which one they are using. In the given example, a DragonSlayer selects and changes its battle strategy depending on the type of dragon it faces. The Strategy pattern is widely used in computer programming for dynamic algorithm selection.
