This code is used to automatically create executables from C++ source files and links them with OpenMP if OpenMP_CXX is found. The code uses the RELATIVE flag for easier extraction of executable names, globbing *.cpp files in the current source directory. For each source file, a target property is set to indicate the linker language as CXX. If OpenMP_CXX is found, it links with the OpenMP library. Finally, the targets are installed in the "bin/search" destination.
