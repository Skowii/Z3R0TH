Testing React components with portals can be difficult, but it's important to focus on ensuring the portalized output is correct rather than testing framework internals. To do this, mock `ReactDOM.createPortal()` in tests. This will work in most cases and maintain confidence in test results. However, separate tests should be conducted for issues related to portals, as portal nodes may sometimes go missing.
