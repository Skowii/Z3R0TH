Create a file drag and drop React component for single file selection. Bind a ref to the component's wrapper for drag and drop events, and create state variables to manage drag state and filename of dropped file. Use methods to handle drag and drop events, and useEffect() hook to handle each event with the created methods. Render a div that changes its appearance based on drag state and dropped file presence. Display the filename if a file is dropped, or prompt the user to drop a file otherwise.
