The Parameter Object pattern in Java simplifies method signatures by encapsulating multiple related parameters into a single object, improving code maintainability and promoting encapsulation. It reduces complexity for the method by handling one form (parameter object) instead of managing multiple pieces of information separately. This design pattern can be applied using a `ParameterObject` class along with the [Builder pattern](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/builder/) to create cleaner and more maintainable Java code.
