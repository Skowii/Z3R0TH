This file is part of the Sylius package. It provides a jQuery plugin called addressBook that allows users to search for data in dropdown lists based on input text. The plugin uses Semantic-UI CSS components and enables developers to add new elements to an existing selection by using specific names for the elements. Once the selection changes, the function updates the values of the other inputs accordingly.
