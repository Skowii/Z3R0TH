The Squiggle link hover effect uses SVG images in CSS to create a whimsical effect on links. The animation involves translating an SVG path along the x-axis, creating the illusion of a squiggle. To apply the effect, use a repeating background for the link and set the `background-image` to the SVG when hovered. This creates a visually engaging experience for users.
