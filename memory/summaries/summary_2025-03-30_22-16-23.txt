Guidelines for reviewers: 
1. Only one active reviewer per PR
2. Assign reviewers only for specific tasks
3. Reviewers should be those who've had their code merged before
4. Ensure pull-requests follow checklists and repo standards
5. Label PRs appropriately, including "invalid"
6. Look for duplicate code or PRs, merge branches into one
7. Discourage direct repo branching, use forked repos
8. Use GitPod for online coding, testing, and CI checks
9. Prioritize quality over speed when merging PRs
