This guide explains how to delete local, remote, detached, and merged branches in Git. To delete a local branch, use `git branch -d <branch>`. To delete a remote branch, use `git push -d <remote> <branch>`. For detached branches, run `git fetch --all --prune`. To delete merged branches, use the commands: `git branch --merged <branch> | grep -v "(^\*|<branch>)" | xargs git branch -d`. Always switch to a different branch before deleting.
