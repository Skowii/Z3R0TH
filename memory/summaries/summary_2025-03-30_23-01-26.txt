Create an animated underline effect when hovering over text using CSS and the `::after` pseudo-element. The underline spans the entire parent element with a width matching the text content, positioned below it. Initially, the underline is hidden and shown on hover by adjusting the transform scale from 0 to 1. A transition can be added to the transform property to control the appearance of the underline growing from one side of the text.
