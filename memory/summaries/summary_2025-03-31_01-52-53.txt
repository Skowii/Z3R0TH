Debouncing is a technique to limit function invocations by waiting for a specific amount of time after each call. To achieve this, use timeouts to create an artificial delay. Clear any pending timeout using `clearTimeout()`, then set a new timeout with `setTimeout()` to delay the function for at least 'ms' milliseconds. Use `Function.prototype.apply()` to provide the necessary arguments and context.
