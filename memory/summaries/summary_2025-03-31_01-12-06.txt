Proxy objects in JavaScript cannot be extended directly, as they are exotic objects without prototypes or extensibility. However, you can create a class that returns a proxy object by defining its behavior within the constructor, which allows for proxy-like functionality. This method involves using a proxy-returning class and setting its properties through a `set()` function that logs the property changes.
