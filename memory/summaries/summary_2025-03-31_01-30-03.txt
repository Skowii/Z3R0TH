This JavaScript method converts a string to a URL-friendly slug using regular expressions. The process includes lowercasing the string, removing special characters and replacing spaces with dashes. The steps are: trimming the string, removing non-alphanumeric characters, replacing word separators (spaces, underscores, and dashes) with single dashes, and removing consecutive dashes at the beginning and end of the string.
