The content proposes unifying buses in Sylius, where all products, including plugins, should use the `sylius.command_bus` for command dispatching and `sylius.event_bus` for events. The command bus requires one handler per message, while the event bus doesn't have such a requirement. Additionally, it mentions that the command bus validates commands, wraps handlers in transactions, and flushes to the database. Currently, two tags are used, `messenger.message_handler`, supporting both `sylius.command_bus` and `sylius_default.bus`.
