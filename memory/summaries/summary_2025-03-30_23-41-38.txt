Appending elements to a JavaScript array can be done using various methods: Array.prototype.push() and Array.prototype.unshift(), which mutate the original array, and Array.prototype.splice(), which also mutates the array but allows appending anywhere. Another method is using Array.prototype.length in combination with array index notation, but this only adds one element at a time to the end of the array. Finally, Array.prototype.concat() creates a new array without mutating the original one and supports adding elements to either end.
