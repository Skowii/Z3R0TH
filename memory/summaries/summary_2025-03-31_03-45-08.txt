The Visitor design pattern in Java is a behavioral pattern that allows new operations to be defined on objects without changing those objects. This separation of operation from object structure enhances code maintainability and extensibility. A real-world example can be seen in a museum, where specialized tour guides explain different types of exhibits. In a Java program, the Visitor pattern is applied to a tree data structure with army units (Commander, Sergeants, Soldiers), allowing new objects to interact with these nodes without modifying them. The pattern involves an abstract Unit class and an interface UnitVisitor, defining methods for each unit type.
