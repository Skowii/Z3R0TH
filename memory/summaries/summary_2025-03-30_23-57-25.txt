In this article, we will look at how to serialize complex JavaScript objects as part of a series on advanced features. The project has a new class, `Serializer`, and a new directory called `serializers`. Serialization converts an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, usually in JSON format. This article presents a flexible serialization approach where a serializer should only need a subject to serialize and options object, then it can produce the desired result with minimal fuss.
