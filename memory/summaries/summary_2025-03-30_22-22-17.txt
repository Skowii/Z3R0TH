Resource prefetching is a technique to improve perceived page speed and user experience by fetching and caching resources when the browser is idle. Adding a `<link>` tag with `rel="prefetch"` in the head or body section hints the browser to download the resource later. Prefetching supports both http and https links, but the preload attribute is an alternative for more specific directions with lower browser support.
