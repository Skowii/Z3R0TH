The given code defines the "is_prime()" function that takes an integer input and checks if it's a prime number. It does this by iterating through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of the input number, checking if any of these candidates divides the input number without remainder. If no candidate divides the number, it returns True indicating a prime number, else returns False. Type and ValueErrors are raised for incorrect inputs.
