The Strategy Pattern in Java allows for encapsulating and interchanging algorithms, enhancing design and maintenance in applications. It separates an algorithm from the clients that use it. A real-world example is car navigation systems using different route calculation strategies. In Java, the `DragonSlayingStrategy` interface can be used to implement various strategies, with the `DragonSlayer` class selecting a strategy based on its needs.
