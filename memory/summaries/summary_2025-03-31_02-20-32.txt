The primary difference between HTMLElement.innerText and Node.textContent is their handling of hidden elements and CSS styles. HTMLElement.innerText ignores hidden elements, rendering the content similar to what a user would see when copying it from the browser. In contrast, Node.textContent includes all text nodes, including those created by CSS styles or invisible elements, resulting in different output. Additionally, HTMLElement.innerText does not support setting style attributes, while Node.textContent does. Overall, understanding these differences is essential for proper usage in JavaScript applications.
