The Null Object Pattern is a Java design pattern that helps manage null references by providing seamless handling without the need for null checks. This simplifies applications and enhances stability. It works similarly to real-world examples, such as customer service systems assigning requests to placeholder "Null Representatives" when no actual representatives are available. This design pattern involves implementing a Node interface with two classes: NodeImpl (for normal nodes) and NullNode (for empty nodes). The Null Object Pattern offers improved code stability and readability in Java applications by providing default behaviors for 'empty' objects.
