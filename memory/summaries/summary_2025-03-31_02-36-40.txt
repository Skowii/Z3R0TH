Create a function that ensures another function is called only once using a closure and a flag initially set to false. The function can have its context changed via apply() or call() methods, and it should accept an arbitrary number of arguments. Example:
```js
const once = fn => {
  let called = false;
  return function(...args) {
    if (called) return;
    called = true;
    return fn.apply(this, args);
  };
};
document.body.addEventListener('click', once(startApp)); // only runs `startApp` once upon click
```
