The sphinxcontrib.redirects extension helps in generating redirects for pages that have been moved when using the HTML builder. It is essential to read the README file for further details. This extension, released in 2017 by Stephen Finucane, has its GitHub repository at https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/redirects. The codebase has undergone some changes like replacing deprecated `app.debug` with `sphinx.util.logging`. It can generate redirects when the builder's name is "html" or "readthedocs".
