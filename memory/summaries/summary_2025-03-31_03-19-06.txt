The Pipeline design pattern in Java is used to facilitate data processing across discrete stages, enhancing modular development and operational efficiency. Real-world examples include assembly lines in car manufacturing, where the process is divided into several stages. This approach allows for easy maintenance, scalability, and flexibility. In software engineering, a pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements that pass their output to the next element in the chain. A programmatic example of the Pipeline pattern in Java involves creating a string-processing pipeline with concrete Handler classes for each stage.
