Composite is a structural design pattern that represents objects in a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern can be applied when you want to represent object hierarchies or when you wish clients to ignore the differences between single objects and compositions of objects. Clients will treat all objects in a composition uniformly.
