The article discusses how to use the Proxy object in JavaScript for type checking objects at runtime. By defining shapes with specific types (e.g., string, number, boolean, or date), a function can be created that creates a shape checker proxy using the Proxy object. This proxy intercepts attempts to set properties and checks if the value being set is of the correct type. If it is, the value is set; otherwise, the operation is not successful. The final example shows creating a proxy for an object with a defined shape to ensure type checking.
