This content describes the process of building Admin JavaScript using Rollup, a module bundler. The process involves using plugins like Uglify, Babel, CommonJS, Concat, and others for specific tasks such as minification, source maps, injecting dependencies, and resolving node modules. The build process is set up with options related to minification and sourcemaps based on the environment variable GULP_ENV. Paths for different directories are obtained using the Yargs library, which parses the command line arguments. The code involves processing paths for various resources like JavaScript files, Sass files, CSS files, and images, and mapping the source paths to their respective destinations.
