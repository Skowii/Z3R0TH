Writing about a topic can provide significant benefits including:

1. Learning more about the subject matter: Conducting thorough research will help uncover gaps in knowledge and lead to a deeper understanding of the topic.
2. Discovering the root of the problem: Presenting the problem to others involves explaining it clearly, often leading to a concise description of its core issue.
3. Understanding past decisions: Examining implementation details and the reasons behind past decisions can help determine if current needs, restrictions, and assumptions are still valid.

Overall, writing about a topic can be enlightening and beneficial for both the writer and their team or organization.
