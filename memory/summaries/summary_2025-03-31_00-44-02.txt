Detect device type using JavaScript involves device detection, which is used for responsive design, analytics, and feature detection. To achieve this, use `Navigator.userAgent` property containing the browser's user agent string. Test the string with a regular expression like `/Mobile|Android|iPhone|iPad/i`, and if it matches, return 'Mobile', otherwise 'Desktop'. Update the expression if needed for specific devices.
