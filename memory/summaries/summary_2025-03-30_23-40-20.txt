JavaScript ES2020 introduced optional chaining and nullish coalescing to simplify working with objects and variables. Optional chaining (`?.`) allows accessing deeply nested object properties without validating each reference, short-circuiting if a reference is nullish. Nullish coalescing (`??`) is a logical operator that checks for nullish values, returning the right-hand side operand when non-nullish, otherwise left-hand side. These features enable cleaner code but require polyfills for older browsers compatibility.
