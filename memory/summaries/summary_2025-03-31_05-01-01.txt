Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that helps to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver by giving multiple objects an opportunity to handle the request. This pattern involves creating a chain of handlers, each with their own responsibility and priority level. The request travels through this chain until it finds an appropriate handler. This allows for more flexible and modular programming where different handlers can be added or removed without affecting the rest of the system.
