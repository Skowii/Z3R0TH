The Data Bus pattern in Java is designed for centralized communication and event handling. It aims to decouple components, enhance scalability, and maintainability by providing a unified channel through which various system parts can exchange information without direct connections. This approach promotes loose coupling and ensures that each entity only receives the data they need. A real-world example is an airport's announcement system, where different entities listen to relevant updates without directly connecting to every other part of the system. Java's Data Bus pattern enables selective notifications based on message types, facilitating targeted communication between components.
