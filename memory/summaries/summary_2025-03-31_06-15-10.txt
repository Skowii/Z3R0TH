This information discusses the AbstractDocument pattern and its use in achieving extensibility and type-safe language features. The pattern allows for the handling of additional non-structural attributes while keeping the core document structure intact. It is designed to protect various properties of different objects with distinct characteristics through interface calls, without needing deep object dives or loss of strong typing. An example using Java is provided. The main goal of the pattern is to achieve a high level of abstraction by adding new attributes in an object-tree without breaking strong typing. This can be achieved by using interfaces and various properties, such as Parts, Type, Price, and Model for objects like Cars.
