The Factory Pattern in Java is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created. It promotes flexibility and scalability in object-oriented code. A real-world example is a bakery's CakeFactory, which handles cake creation without the need to change core recipes. In Java, the Factory Pattern can be implemented by defining an interface with implementations and providing a factory class with static methods for creating objects based on types. This pattern allows easy addition of new object types without modifying existing source code.
