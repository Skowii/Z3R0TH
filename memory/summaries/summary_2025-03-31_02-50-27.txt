The article discusses how to partition a JavaScript array into two or more arrays based on a given condition. It covers the concept of partitioning and provides an implementation using `Array.prototype.reduce()` for two-partition and a `Map` object for multiple partitions. The implementation uses `fn`, which is a provided function that returns a truthy value to group elements into one array and false to group them in another. For more than two partitions, a `Map` object is used, allowing the creation of as many arrays as needed based on the return value of the given function. The final step involves using `Map.prototype.values()` to convert the `Map` object's values into an array.
