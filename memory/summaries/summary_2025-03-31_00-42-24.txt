To find the most frequent element in a JavaScript array, you can use Array.prototype.reduce() method for both primitive values and objects. For primitives, initialize an object with unique values as keys and their frequencies as values using the nullish coalescing operator (??). Then, reduce the object to find the most frequent value. 

For objects, create a mapping function that returns the value you want to compare. Use this in place of the primitive value comparison in the reduce() method. The resulting value will always be a string, so use a Map to store frequencies and then find the most frequent value.
