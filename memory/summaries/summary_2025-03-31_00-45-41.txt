The provided information discusses comparing two JavaScript objects to determine if they have the same properties and values. It suggests creating a function that checks whether the first object contains equivalent property values to the second one. This involves iterating over the keys of the second object using `Object.keys()`, then checking if each key exists in the first object using `Array.prototype.every()` and `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`. If a strict equality operator (`===`) is used, it will ensure values are not only equal but also of the same type. 

Additionally, a custom function can be provided to determine value equality. The given example uses a function that receives the property value in both objects, key, and the objects themselves.

Lastly, if comparing two objects in both directions is needed, a set of keys from both objects can be created and checked for equal size. Then, iterate over the keys of the set and verify each key exists in both objects.
