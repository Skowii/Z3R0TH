Balking pattern is a design pattern used to prevent execution of a certain code when an object is in an undesired state. In real-world example, consider a washing machine with a start button. The button only initiates the washing process when the machine is not already running, but does nothing if it's already in use. Balking pattern ensures that a specific method or operation is performed only when the object reaches a specific condition. Wikipedia describes it as a software design pattern where an action is carried out only when an object reaches a particular state. For instance, a zip file reading operation activates a get method on an object when a zip file is not opened, causing the object to be in a "blocked" state.

In the given example, `WashingMachine` is an object with two states: enabled and washing. If the machine is in the enabled state, threadsafely it transitions to the washing state. However, if another thread is already washing and the machine is in the washing state, no action is performed until the washing process is completed. This design pattern ensures that only a specific method or operation is performed when the object reaches a specific condition.
