The Front Controller design pattern is a Java architectural pattern that centralizes web request handling, improving efficiency and consistency across a web application. It acts as a single point for receiving and managing all incoming requests, delegating them to specific handlers when necessary. This centralized approach helps in maintaining a consistent and efficient request routing system in web applications.
