This guide explains how to set the value of a select input in React using various methods. One common way is by adding a `selected` attribute to an option's element, while another way involves using React's shared API with `value` or `defaultValue` properties to set the field's value. Additionally, creating a reusable component with an uncontrolled select input can be achieved by using the `selectedValue` prop as the default value and passing the new value to the parent through the `onChange` event.
