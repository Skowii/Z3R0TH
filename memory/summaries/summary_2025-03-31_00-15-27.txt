Create a JavaScript generator function based on a condition:

1. Take a predicate function as an argument
2. Initialize current value using seed
3. Use while loop with condition based on the predicate function
4. Iterate as long as the condition is met
5. Use yield to return the current val and optionally receive new seed
6. Use next function to calculate next value from current val and new seed
7. Return the final value

Example:

```js
const generateWhile = function* (seed, predicate, next) {
  let val = seed;
  let nextSeed = null;
  while (predicate(val)) {
    nextSeed = yield val;
    val = next(val, nextSeed);
  }
  return val;
};
[...generateWhile(1, v => v <= 5, v => ++v)] // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
