To get N elements from the start or end of a JavaScript array, use `Array.prototype.slice()`. For the first N elements, pass 0 as the starting index and n as the ending index: `arr.slice(0, n)`. For the last N elements, pass a negative index to `Array.prototype.slice()`: `arr.slice(-n)`. To prevent odd behaviors with negative values or `n = 0`, you can add validation code to these methods.
