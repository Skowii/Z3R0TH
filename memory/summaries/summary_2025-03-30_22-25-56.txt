Using the `viewport` meta tag incorrectly can cause accessibility issues for people with low vision. Employing `maximum-scale=1.0` disables pinch zoom functionality on mobile devices, taking away user control and providing a poor experience. To avoid this, use correct setup: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`. Some browsers and devices might ignore the suggestion, leading to inconsistent experiences for users.
