Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates requests as objects, allowing for parametrization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undoing operations. The main idea is to store commands as objects to perform an action or reverse it later. In object-oriented programming, the Command pattern helps to encapsulate all necessary information for an action or event to be executed at a later time. An example involves a wizard casting spells on a goblin, with each spell being an object of command that can be undone. The code example demonstrates this using classes Wizard and Goblin, where the Wizard casts spells on the Goblin by encapsulating them as objects in stacks and allowing for undoing or redos based on user input.
