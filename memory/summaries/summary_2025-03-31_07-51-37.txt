The Double-Checked Locking Pattern in Java is a design pattern used to reduce overhead of acquiring a lock while ensuring thread safety during object initialization. It first checks the locking criterion without actually acquiring the lock and only proceeds with actual locking if necessary. This pattern optimizes performance and minimizes resource-intensive operations, making it suitable for real-world examples like access control systems in high-value equipment rooms. A programmatic example of this pattern can be found in Java's `HolderThreadSafe` class.
