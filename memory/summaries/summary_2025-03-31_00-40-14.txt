This information teaches us how to easily remove duplicates from a JavaScript array using the built-in `Set` object and provides different ways to approach this task. The article explains how to get all unique values in an array by initializing a `Set` object from the array's values, converting it back to an array with unique values using the spread operator. It also covers how to check if an array contains duplicates, keeping only values that are not duplicated, and removing all values that appear only once. Additionally, it explains how to use a function to find duplicates in more complex data types such as objects.
