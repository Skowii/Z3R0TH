CSS variables, also known as custom properties, work like variables in other programming languages and allow you to define named values that can be reused throughout your code and designs. They're particularly helpful for sharing styles between different elements and components, theming, dark mode implementation, and defining shared customized styles. The syntax involves prefixing variable names with two dashes (e.g., `--my-color`), and the variables are accessed using the `var()` function.
