Async Method Invocation (AMI) refers to invoking methods without blocking the calling thread while waiting for results, providing concurrent method handling and returning results through callbacks or by waiting until the operation is completed. It utilizes the AMI pattern in which the call doesn't block during execution, and instead a callback is invoked when the task is finished. The AMI can be compared to asynchronous patterns such as Promises and Observables used in various programming languages.
