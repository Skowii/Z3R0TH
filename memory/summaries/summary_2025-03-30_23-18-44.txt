Named tuples in Python are part of the collections module and offer an alternative way to represent tuples. They allow accessing values using field names rather than indexes, making code more readable. Named tuples also provide features such as default values, automatic renaming of fields, and flexible ways to specify field names. Despite these additional features, named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, requiring the same memory usage as regular tuples.
