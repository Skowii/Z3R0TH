This code snippet automates the process of building and installing executables from C++ source files using CMake. The RELATIVE flag is used to extract executable names, and each source file's full pathname. It then generates an executable based on the file type (e.g., .cpp) and installs it in a specified folder destination (bin/physics). Additionally, if OpenMP_CXX is found, it links the target library for OpenMP support.
