This passage teaches how to convert the data from an HTML form into a JavaScript object or serialize it into a query string. To do this, you can use the `FormData` interface which allows for easy construction of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values. You can either create an object using `Object.fromEntries()`, converting a `FormData` object, or serialize the data into a query string by mapping each entry to a string with an `encodeURIComponent()`.
