This file is part of the Sylius package, and contains a jQuery function that updates a slug input based on the text entered in an associated input field. The slug input gets updated via an AJAX call to a specified URL, and this function also handles toggling the read-only state of the slug input along with its corresponding button. The code adds event listeners for input changes and button clicks to handle the functionality.
