JavaScript's "strict mode" enforces stricter parsing and error handling when applied to entire scripts or individual functions using the statement 'use strict'. It provides various benefits including no accidental global variables, elimination of silent errors, simplified `eval`, simplified `arguments` and no `this` boxing. Strict mode makes code more secure and clean, while potentially improving performance by reducing the likelihood of unexpected behavior.
