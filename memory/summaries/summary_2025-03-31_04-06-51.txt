Unit of Work, also known as 工作单元, is an architectural pattern used in data access to minimize database round trips when multiple updates are made during a business transaction. It maintains a list of objects affected by the transaction and coordinates write operations and concurrency resolution. The pattern involves batching updates for efficient processing, reducing database server load, and ensuring correctness and consistency of data.
