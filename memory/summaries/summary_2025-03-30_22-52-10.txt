To purge a file from Git history, use `git rm` to remove the file from the working directory and index. Then, run `git filter-branch --force --index-filter <command> --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all` to rewrite the branch's history, passing the previous command as an argument. Finally, force push changes to the remote repository with `git push <remote> --force --all`. This is a destructive action and requires caution; be aware that it rewrites the entire repository history.
