The Data Sampling block allows users to choose a smaller subset of data from a larger dataset by applying various sampling methods. Inputs include a dataset, sample size, and the chosen sampling method like random, systematic, stratified, weighted, reservoir, or cluster sampling. Outputs consist of sampled data and its indices, which can be useful for representative samples in analysis tasks.
