The Microservices Aggregator Pattern is a design pattern used in Java to aggregate responses from multiple microservices into a single unified response, enhancing client-server interactions and scalability in large systems. It simplifies the user experience by providing all necessary information in one place, reducing the number of direct interactions with underlying services. In real-world examples, such as a travel booking platform or a web marketplace, an Aggregator Microservice collects data from multiple microservices (flights, hotels, car rentals; product and inventory information) and consolidates it into a single response. Java code examples demonstrate the Aggregator pattern by utilizing clients that call respective microservices to fetch the required information.
