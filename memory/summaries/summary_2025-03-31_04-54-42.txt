The Business Delegate pattern decouples a presentation layer from the application logic, allowing for a loose connection between them while hiding the implementation details of services such as search and access to business objects. This pattern is also known as Service Proxy or simply Delegate. In this example, a mobile app requests to play a movie, which is passed to the Business Delegate. The delegate then checks the service that should be used based on the movie title, either NetflixService or YouTubeService. It returns one of these services to VideoStreamingService, which then begins video playback. This pattern helps reduce interdependencies between layers and simplifies maintenance and testing.
