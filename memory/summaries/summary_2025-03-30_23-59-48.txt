Implement K-nearest neighbors algorithm in JavaScript to classify data points relative to a labeled dataset. Calculate Euclidean distance using map(), find the k nearest neighbors using sort() and slice(), identify the most frequent label using reduce(), and return the classification. The time complexity is O(n) for each classification, with n being the number of data points, while space complexity is also O(n). This algorithm is non-parametric and lazy, making it suitable for online learning scenarios.
