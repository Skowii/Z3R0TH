The Registry Pattern in Java is a design pattern used to centralize object management for improved access and control. It provides a single point of access for registering, tracking, and retrieving information about objects. In real-world examples, it can be used in IT asset management systems or any software where managing global collections of objects is necessary. The Registry Pattern involves two methods: one for adding objects to the registry and one for returning objects based on a key. It promotes efficient utilization and maintenance, ensures compliance with licenses, and helps in planning upgrades or replacements. A programmatic example includes storing `Customer` records with IDs and names as objects, ensuring controlled lifecycles and avoiding redundant creations.
