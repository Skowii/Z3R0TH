Sylius Payment Component is a raw architecture for managing payments and payment methods, not providing any gateways by default. It integrates with Payum by default, and is part of the Sylius eCommerce solution built from decoupled components with powerful API. Documentation is available at docs.sylius.com, with contributors following GitHub issues for bug tracking. The component was originally created by Paweł Jędrzejewski, with a list of contributors available on GitHub.
