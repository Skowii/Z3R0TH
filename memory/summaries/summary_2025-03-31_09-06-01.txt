The code provides functions for getting and reading data files. The "data" function retrieves a data file based on its name, using the suffix to identify the type of file (either CSV or JSON). It then returns the appropriate reader function from the "readers" dictionary. The "path" function locates the file path based on the given name in the specified package. The "csv" and "json" functions read CSV and JSON files respectively, using pandas library.
