AutoGPT Classic was an experimental project that demonstrated autonomous GPT-4 operation, allowing it to independently operate and chain together tasks to achieve more complex goals. The project has now concluded its initial research phase, and its dependencies will not be updated. If you want to use AutoGPT, consider using the AutoGPT Platform instead. For those interested in autonomous AI agents, you can still explore the codebase for educational purposes or refer to it while exploring more actively maintained alternatives. The project includes key features like autonomous task chaining, tool and API integration capabilities, memory management, web browsing, file operations, content creation, and self-prompting.
