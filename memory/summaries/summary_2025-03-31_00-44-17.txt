This article explains how to copy text to the clipboard using JavaScript. The recommended method is to use the Asynchronous Clipboard API, which is supported in modern browsers and offers a secure solution. To do this, one needs to ensure that `Navigator`, `Navigator.clipboard`, and `Navigator.clipboard.writeText` are truthy, then call `Clipboard.writeText()`. If the Clipboard API isn't available or for support of older browsers, one can use the legacy method involving `Document.execCommand('copy')`. This involves creating a hidden `<textarea>`, appending it to the document with selected text, then copying its contents to the clipboard.
