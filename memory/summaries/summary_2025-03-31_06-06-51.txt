Active Object is a design pattern for concurrency in programming. It separates the method execution from its invocation, using asynchronous method calls and a scheduler to manage requests. The goal is to introduce concurrent processing without using synchronized methods. This pattern can be used for objects that reside on their own threads of control. An example in real-world code demonstrates implementing an active object class in Java.
