AutoGPT has moved from using Legacy plugins to a component-based architecture for greater flexibility and ease of extension. This new system replaces the older plugin system with a more modular design, where an agent is composed of components that implement specific protocols. Each protocol offers particular functionality, such as additional commands or messages. The new system allows for clearer separation of concerns and increased modularity without hiding any data.
