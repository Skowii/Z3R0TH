The Service Stub pattern in Java allows for testing or development without relying on an external service by providing a dummy implementation of that service. This pattern isolates behavior during testing and ensures predictable results. In the example of Sentiment Analysis, a real implementation would randomly decide sentiment, whereas a stub implementation would return predefined responses based on input text. The pattern is achieved using an interface with two implementations: a RealSentimentAnalysisServer for simulating the slow, random service, and a StubSentimentAnalysisServer to provide deterministic results.
