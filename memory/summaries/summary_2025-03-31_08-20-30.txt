The Notification design pattern in Java enhances system communication with event alerts by allowing objects to subscribe to specific events and receive updates asynchronously when those events occur. This pattern facilitates decoupling between publisher and subscribers, delivering timely updates efficiently. A real-world example is a weather alert system where a weather station publishes data on weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and storm alerts to interested parties such as news agencies and emergency services. Programmatically, this pattern can be implemented in Java to capture information passed between layers, validate the information, and return errors to the presentation layer if needed. This reduces coupling, enhances flexibility and reusability of components, and allows for dynamic event subscription and unsubscription.
