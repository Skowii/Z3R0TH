The script uses the RELATIVE flag to list source files and extract executable names automatically. It globally collects CPP files (APP_SOURCES), then iterates through them using a foreach loop to build executables with their respective names. Each executable is set with CXX linker language and, if OpenMP is found, linked to the OpenMP library. The targets are installed in the "bin/data_structures" folder. Finally, the cll subdirectory is added.
