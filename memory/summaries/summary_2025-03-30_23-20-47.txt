This article explains two ways to format a string in Python: f-strings and str.format(). F-strings use replacement fields enclosed in curly braces and are prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. An example is `f'{name} is {age} years old'`. The str.format() method, on the other hand, uses the format function and supplies the replacement fields as arguments. For instance, `'{0} is {1} years old'.format(name, age)`.
