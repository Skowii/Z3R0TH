React is a powerful library for building user interfaces but can be fragile in some cases. A common bug occurs when direct DOM manipulation combines with React, which can break an application if not handled properly. This issue arises when the virtual and real DOMs are different, causing a failed DOMException and app breakdown. To resolve this problem, ensure that any element removal is part of the component's state management and interact with its state instead of using direct DOM manipulation.
