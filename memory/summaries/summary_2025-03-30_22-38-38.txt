In React, using multiple useState hooks can cause difficulties during debugging. However, there's an easy solution: use the useDebugValue hook with a custom useStateWithLabel hook. This helps in labelling useState values and makes it easier to inspect them in React developer tools. The label can be ignored during production builds by abstracting it.
