JavaScript's arrow functions might seem similar to regular functions, but there are some important differences:

1. Syntax - Arrow functions have a more concise syntax and support implicit return shorthand and parenthesis around single arguments.
2. Execution context - The `this` value in arrow functions is lexically bound and cannot be changed using methods like `Function.prototype.call()`, `Function.prototype.bind()`, or `Function.prototype.apply()`.
3. Methods - Arrow functions are not ideal for use as methods due to their lack of defining an execution context. However, they can be used in classes if your environment supports the Class fields proposal.
4. Constructors - Regular functions can be used as constructors with the `new` keyword, while arrow functions cannot define their own execution context.
5. Arguments binding - Arrow functions bind the value of `arguments` to the parent function scope, which might lead to unexpected results in certain cases.

Due to these differences, it's essential to understand the nuances between arrow and regular functions when choosing which to use in a specific situation.
