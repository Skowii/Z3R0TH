The Function Composition design pattern in Java allows for creating complex functions by combining simpler ones, enhancing modular code and reusability. Real-world examples include breaking down a process into multiple steps (functions) like making a burger or managing restaurant menu items. In Java, functional interfaces can be used to define simple functions, which can then be composed using higher-order functions to build more complicated ones, simplifying management, testing, and reuse of individual functionality.
