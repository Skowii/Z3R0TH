The Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern is a structural design pattern used in Java applications to simplify data transfer between software layers, particularly during network calls or database retrievals. It helps optimize communication by aggregating the required data into a single transfer object. This reduces the number of method calls and improves data handling efficiency without compromising standardized format across different subsystems.
