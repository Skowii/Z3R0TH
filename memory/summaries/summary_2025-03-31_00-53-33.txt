This information provides a generator function to find all indexes of a substring in a JavaScript string. The function uses the `String.prototype.indexOf()` method with a second argument to start the search, and continues searching by incrementing the starting index until no occurrence is found. A yield statement returns each index found during the search, while a return statement terminates the generator when no more occurrences are found. Examples showcase the usage of this function for different strings and substrings.
