The Special Case design pattern in Java simplifies handling exceptional cases without cluttering main code logic. It isolates unique conditions and specific scenarios for maintainable code. This pattern is applied by using subclasses that encapsulate special behaviors, separating them from the general case. Real-world examples include emergency vehicles in a toll booth system or special scenarios in an e-commerce system. The Null Object pattern can be considered a special case of Special Case.
