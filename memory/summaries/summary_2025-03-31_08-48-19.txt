The script takes in a WAV file using argparse and waveio libraries. It then uses matplotlib to create a plot of the waveform of the audio using the given start and end times (defaults to the entire file). The format of the time axis is handled with a custom formatter. This plots each channel on its own sub-axis if there are multiple channels, allowing for clear visualization of the waveform over time. The plotting code uses pyplot's subplots function, which allows for easy creation and configuration of subplots. The script also provides the filename as the title of the figure to give context. Lastly, it uses plt.show() to show the figure, making the plot interactive.
