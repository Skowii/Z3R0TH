This website introduces Java design patterns, which are fundamental solutions for common problems in developing applications or systems. These patterns have been tested and proven to be effective in the development process and help prevent issues related to delicate matters while improving readability of code for experienced developers and architects. The site provides explanations and source code examples of various design patterns that can be used as programming tutorials. It uses widely recognized open-source Java technologies and adheres to the KISS and YAGNI principles. By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you can select a suitable design pattern from a list to solve a problem - searching by name, using tags such as 'Performance,' or browsing categories like 'Creational' or 'Behavioral.' The website aims to provide object-oriented solutions that are useful and enjoyable for your architecture. If you want to contribute, visit the developer wiki.
