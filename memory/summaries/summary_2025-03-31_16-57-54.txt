The YearDateObject class is created to represent a year's date range and intervals. It has properties such as startDate, endDate, prevDate, nextDate, maxGraphDate, and interval (set as 'month'). The constructor initializes the object by taking a given date, using it to set start and end dates for the current and next year, and defining previous and next years' dates. Additionally, it sets the maxGraphDate to the following year's first day and the interval to 'month'.
