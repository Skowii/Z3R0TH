Function arity refers to the number of arguments a function expects. It can be retrieved using `Function.prototype.length`. In functional programming, understanding arity can help in limiting the number of arguments a function accepts and working with variadic functions. Some examples include nullary (no arguments), unary (one argument), binary (two arguments), and n-ary (exactly `n` arguments) functions. By using techniques like currying and the spread operator, we can easily manipulate functions' arity.
