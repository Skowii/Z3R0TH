A game loop is a continuous process during a gaming session, handling inputs, updating the game's state, and rendering it. It manages time progress to control gameplay pace, separating user input and processor speed from the game's time progression. This pattern is present in all game engines. The central programming component of any game is the game loop, ensuring smooth execution regardless of user input or hardware configurations. A simple example includes moving bullets in a game. The GameController class manages the movement of objects including a bullet, while the GameLoop class provides a thread for handling inputs and updates.
