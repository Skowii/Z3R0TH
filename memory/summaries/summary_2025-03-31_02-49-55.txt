In JavaScript, you can check if a string is uppercase or lowercase using simple tricks. For uppercase strings:

1. Use the `String.prototype.toUpperCase()` method to convert the string to uppercase.
2. Compare the original string with the converted string. If they are equal, it's an uppercase string.

For lowercase strings:

1. Use the `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` method to convert the string to lowercase.
2. Compare the original string with the converted string. If they are equal, it's a lowercase string.

However, this approach doesn't work for non-alphabetic characters. To handle them:

1. Use regular expressions with anchors (^ and $), character ranges ([A-Z] or [a-z]), positive lookahead (?=), quantifiers (+) and the end of string anchor ($).
2. Use `RegExp.prototype.test()` method to check if the string matches the regular expression.
