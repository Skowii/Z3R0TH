Rendering is the process in React where components are updated based on their props and state. It moves through the component tree, collecting render outputs which are then used to update the DOM. The rendering phase is followed by a commit phase, during which changes to the DOM are applied. React can re-render components due to changes in props or state, or when called upon again. However, this can lead to unnecessary calculations and time spent on rendering. Optimization techniques can be employed to improve performance and reduce redundant work.
