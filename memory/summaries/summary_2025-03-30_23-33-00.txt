Implement the Observer pattern in JavaScript using Proxy and EventTarget interfaces. The Observable class extends the EventTarget interface, while a Proxy object intercepts property changes via its set trap. Create CustomEvents to notify observers of any changes, and dispatch events to update all registered listeners. This technique can be extended for more complex use cases like nested objects or arrays, or used to create an observable store similar to Redux.
