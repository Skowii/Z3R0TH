State, also known as "对象状态" in Chinese, is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It's often used when an object's behavior depends on its current state and when there are many condition statements related to the states. The pattern involves moving condition branches into separate classes so objects can be treated as independent entities that can vary independently from other objects.
