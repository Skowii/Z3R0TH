This Memory Challenge requires an agent, Follow-Instructions-GPT, to read and follow a series of text files containing instructions with different task IDs. The agent reads each `instructions_n.txt` file, keeps track of the task ID, and eventually writes the final task ID in a file named output.txt. Completing this challenge shows the agent's ability to follow multiple sets of instructions while maintaining memory of the assigned tasks.
