The Transaction Script Pattern in Java is a design pattern that simplifies business logic by organizing procedures to handle individual requests from the presentation layer. This approach makes it easier for bank tellers, for instance, to manage various transactions without needing complex systems of rules and interactions. In Java, the Hotel class uses the Transaction Script pattern to book and cancel room reservations, ensuring proper execution and organization of each transaction.
