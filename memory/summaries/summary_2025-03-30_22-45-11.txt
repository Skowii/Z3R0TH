Create a commit with a different author or change the last commit's author using Git by specifying their name and email with `--author` or `--amend --author`. Changing an author will also alter the SHA-1 checksum, requiring forced pushes to remote repositories. If your repo requires signed commits, ensure you have the original author's GPG key. Multiple authors can be added by separate methods.
