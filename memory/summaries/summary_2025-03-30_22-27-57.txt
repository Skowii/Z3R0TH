Testing React components with asynchronous updates is a common issue when working on projects that involve libraries like React DnD for drag and drop systems. In this case, the React Testing Library was used to write tests for a Card component that uses React DnD. The tests faced an issue where the expected component state update wasn't happening immediately after firing events. To resolve this, using the `act()` function within the test was recommended to ensure testing the behavior seen in the browser.
