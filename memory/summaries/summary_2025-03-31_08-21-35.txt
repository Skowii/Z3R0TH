Context Object Pattern in Java: Simplifying Access to Contextual Data

The Context Object pattern helps encapsulate state and behaviors relevant to users or requests in a Java application, decoupling components from environmental complexities. This design pattern is useful for managing context efficiently. Real-world examples demonstrate how various services access shared passenger data at an airport without being tightly coupled. In Java, this pattern can be implemented by defining the `ServiceContext` object and using the `ServiceContextFactory` interface to create context objects in different layers of the application. This improves overall performance and maintainability.
