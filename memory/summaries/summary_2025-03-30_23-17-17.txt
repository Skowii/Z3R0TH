This article explains how to create a simple zoom in zoom out animation using CSS. The three-step animation is defined using `@keyframes`, where the element's size starts at its original state (scale: 100%), scales up halfway through (e.g., scale: 150%), and returns to its original size at the end (scale: 100%). The animation is then applied to an element using the `animation` property with adjustable timing, easing, and loop settings. For browser compatibility, use `transform: scale(1, 1)` and `transform: scale(1.5, 1.5)` instead of `scale`.
