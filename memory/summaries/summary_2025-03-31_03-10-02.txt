The Gateway design pattern is an essential concept in Java for simplifying API integration and interactions with remote services. It provides a unified interface to external systems, enhancing maintainability and promoting modular and scalable software design. By encapsulating these interactions, the Gateway pattern ensures loose coupling and promotes efficient application development.

Real-world example: A logistics company uses multiple third-party services for various operations like shipping, inventory management, and customer notifications. Each service has its own API with different protocols and data formats. The company implements a Gateway design pattern to simplify the interaction. This gateway acts as a unified interface for all third-party service interactions, allowing internal systems to communicate with these services seamlessly. It handles translation of protocols, data transformation, and routing of requests, ensuring loose coupling between internal and external components.

Programmatic Example: A `Gateway` interface is defined first. This interface represents the contract for our external services. Each service that needs to be interacted with will implement this interface. Following this, the external services are created. These services implement the `Gateway` interface and provide a unified interface for all third-party interactions.
