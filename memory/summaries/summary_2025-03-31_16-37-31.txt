The new unified API's endpoints lacked clear guidelines, so separating admin and shop routes was proposed. This separation would simplify API usage and improve relations between resources. However, issues arose such as different serialization for users and contextual endpoint resolution. Two options were considered: 1) using the current solution with one endpoint for products or 2) adding an additional suffix to the path for admin users. The second option is preferred because it treats product presentations as separate resources, clearly distinguishing endpoints for admins and shop users, and making authorization easier.
