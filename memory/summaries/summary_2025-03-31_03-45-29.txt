The Event Queue pattern in Java is a design pattern used to manage tasks in an asynchronous manner, allowing applications to handle operations without blocking user interactions or other processes. This improves system performance and scalability. Real-world examples include email systems and modern messaging platforms. A programmatic example of the Event Queue pattern involves creating instances of classes with a queue for audio play requests and controlling thread operations for asynchronous processing.
