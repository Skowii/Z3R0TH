Find the head and tail of a JavaScript array without mutating it using the following methods:

1. Destructuring assignment: `const [head, ...tail] = arr;`. This also works with empty arrays.
2. Individual functions for getting the head or tail:
   - Head: `head(arr) => (arr && arr.length ? arr[0] : undefined);`
   - Tail: `tail(arr) => (arr && arr.length > 1 ? arr.slice(1) : []);`

Both functions need to check if the value is array-like and apply extra handling for edge cases.
