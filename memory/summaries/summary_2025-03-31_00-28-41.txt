The Node.js test module is a new experimental testing tool in development, currently not recommended for production use. It does not require third-party dependencies and is easy to set up. To use the module, import the 'node:test' module and possibly the assertion module ('node:assert/strict'). You can then write tests using the test function, which takes two arguments - a name and a fn (function) containing the test logic. To run tests from the command line, use the 'node --test' command or specify file patterns manually.
