Create a hover effect where the gradient follows the mouse cursor using CSS and JavaScript, making use of CSS custom properties and DOM manipulation. The HTML structure involves using a button with a span child to contain the text that will be hovered over. The gradient is applied to the button's pseudo-element and its position is tracked using JavaScript to update two CSS variables --x and --y. These variable updates cause the gradient to follow the mouse cursor, giving an interactive visual effect.
