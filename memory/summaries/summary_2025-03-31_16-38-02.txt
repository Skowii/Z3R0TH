The content discusses the proposal of using IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) instead of code/id in API requests, providing more clarity and consistency with API Platform. The main challenge is the usage of IRI in requests while needing `id`/`code` in commands and command handlers. The chosen option is to handle and transform IRI to `id`/`code`, creating a unified structure and making the API easier to use.
