The Publish to Medium block is a tool that enables direct publication of content to the Medium platform from within an automated workflow. It takes a fully formatted blog post with associated metadata and publishes it to Medium using its API, handling all aspects of the publication process. The block requires inputs such as Author ID, Title, Content, Tags, Canonical URL, Publish Status, License, and Notify Followers, and outputs Post ID, Post URL, Published At, and Error messages. This block can be integrated into a content management system to streamline cross-platform publishing for digital marketing teams.
