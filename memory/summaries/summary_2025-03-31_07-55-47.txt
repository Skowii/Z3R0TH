The Template Method pattern simplifies complex algorithms by allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without altering algorithm structure. This design pattern outlines invariant steps in a parent class while permitting customization in child classes, promoting code reusability and design flexibility in Java programming. In real-world examples such as making tea or coffee, the Template Method pattern establishes consistent processes while allowing different brewing methods. The pattern is also useful for tasks like stealing an item by following general steps and enabling specific implementations tailored to individual thieves' methods.
