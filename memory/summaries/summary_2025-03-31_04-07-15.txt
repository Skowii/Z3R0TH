Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class is created, and provides a global access point for it. This pattern is useful when there is only one object required to coordinate various operations in the system. A common example is logging classes or managing database connections. EnumIvoryTower, used as an example, demonstrates how to implement Singleton using an enum type. The Singleton pattern can lead to code becoming more coupled and making testing difficult for clients.
