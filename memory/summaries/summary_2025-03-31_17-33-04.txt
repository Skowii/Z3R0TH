AutoGPT has a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature, which can be used by running the command `./autogpt.sh --speak`. Eleven Labs provides voice technologies such as voice design and speech synthesis that can be utilized by AutoGPT. To use them, follow these steps: 1) Create an account on ElevenLabs if you don't have one already; 2) Set up the Starter plan; 3) Find your API Key in your profile settings. In the .env file, set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_1_ID`, where the Voice ID can be chosen from a list of available voices like Rachel, Domi, Bella, Antoni, Elli, Josh, Arnold, Adam, or Sam.
