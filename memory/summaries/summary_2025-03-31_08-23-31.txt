The Virtual Proxy Design Pattern in Java enhances performance by controlling the creation and access of resource-intensive objects through lazy loading techniques. This pattern acts as a surrogate for another object, optimizing resource management and providing efficient resource handling when dealing with large, data-intensive operations. Real-world examples include high-end art galleries displaying photographs instead of artwork or online video streaming platforms using virtual proxies to control video object creation. A programmatic example in Java involves defining an ExpensiveObject interface and creating a virtual proxy that deferred the creation of actual video objects until required for playback.
