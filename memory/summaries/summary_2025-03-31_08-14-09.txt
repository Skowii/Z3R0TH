The Decorator Pattern in Java allows for dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without modifying their existing code. It enhances flexibility by wrapping objects within objects with similar interfaces, creating a more extensible design. Real-world examples include customizing coffee orders or arming trolls with weapons. Programmatic examples involve implementing the Troll interface and dynamically decorating objects with additional functionality.
