The following code snippet demonstrates how to check if an element is visible in the viewport using JavaScript. It uses `Element.getBoundingClientRect()` and `Window.innerWidth`, `Window.innerHeight` properties to determine the coordinates of the element and dimensions of the viewport, respectively. An optional argument is used to check if the element is entirely or partially visible.
