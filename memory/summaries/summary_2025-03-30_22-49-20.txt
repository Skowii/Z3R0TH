Learn how to rewind back to a specific commit in Git when you've made a mistake but haven't pushed your changes yet. Use `git reset` with the `--hard` flag to undo, unstage, and delete changes or use it with the `HEAD~<n>` syntax for a given number of commits. Be cautious using the `--hard` flag as it is destructive. If you've pushed your changes, consider using `git revert` to undo a commit without rewriting history.
