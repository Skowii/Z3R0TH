Hoisting in JavaScript refers to the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. While both declarations are hoisted, initializations are not. Variables declared with 'var' return 'undefined' when accessed before initialization, while const and let return errors. It is best practice to define variables, functions, objects, and classes before using them and prefer 'const' and 'let' over 'var'.
