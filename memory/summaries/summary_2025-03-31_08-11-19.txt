The Promise design pattern in Java is used for managing asynchronous operations efficiently, providing a placeholder for results that are initially unknown but will be resolved later. It enhances code readability and maintainability with practical examples and detailed explanations. This pattern is also known as Deferred or Future. Real-world examples include online pizza ordering systems and file downloading tasks with operations like line counting and character frequency analysis. In Java, the Promise design pattern can be implemented using ExecutorService and associated handlers to handle an asynchronous action's success value or failure reason.
