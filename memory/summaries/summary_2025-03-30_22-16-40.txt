The text describes a process to build executables from source files. It uses the RELATIVE flag for listing source files, making it easier to extract an executable name automatically. It then iterates through each file (with .cpp extension), strips off the extension to get the test name and builds an executable using that name. The build also sets the target properties to CXX language and checks if OpenMP_CXX is found, linking it with the target if so. Finally, it installs the built targets in the "bin/geometry" destination.
