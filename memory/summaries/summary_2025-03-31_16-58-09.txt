The Sylius Inventory Bundle is a Symfony application that provides flexible inventory management for ecommerce and shop needs. It requires PHP version 7.4 or 8.0, works with the Sylius/Inventory and Sylius/Resource-Bundle packages, and has compatibility with Symfony/Framework-Bundle, Symfony/Templating, and Symfony/Validator modules. The bundle conflicts with Twig/Twig version 1.0, but is compatible with other dependencies including Doctrine/ORM, PHPUnit/PHPUnit, and Symfony/Browser-Kit and other related packages. It also supports PSR-4 autoloading and works in both stable and development environments.
