The Lockable Object design pattern in Java aims to control access to a shared resource in multithreaded environments by providing a mechanism for resource locking, ensuring only one thread can access the resource at a time. This ensures thread safety and proper resource management in concurrent programming. Real-world example: A shared printer in an office ensures that only one print job runs at a time. The Lockable Object pattern uses locking mechanisms to prevent overlapping or interfering tasks, allowing for synchronization and controlled access to shared resources. Java implements this pattern through the use of the `Lockable` interface instead of using the `synchronized` keyword directly on methods.
