This JavaScript information concisely:

Check if an array includes any or all values from another array. Use `Array.prototype.includes()` and `Array.prototype.some()` or `Array.prototype.every()`, respectively, to perform this task. The code snippets might perform poorly for large arrays, so consider using a `Set` for improved performance.
