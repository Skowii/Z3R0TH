This article describes three ways to swap the values of two variables in Python: using a temporary variable, tuple packing and sequence unpacking, or arithmetic operators. The first method involves a temporary variable to store and swap values. The second method utilizes tuple swapping without creating an additional variable. Finally, for numbered variables, arithmetic operators can be used to perform the swap by finding the sum and difference of the values.
