The JavaScript constructor method is used for creating and initializing objects of a class. When invoked with `new`, an object is created, its constructor is assigned to the invoked constructor, and the object is then assigned to `this`. If there is no valid return value specified in the constructor, the constructor will implicitly return the `this` object. However, you can explicitly return a different object by using a `return` statement within the constructor. This use-case is usually for classes implemented as singletons or those managing their instances' number. It is important to avoid unoptimized constructors, as they may cause confusion.
