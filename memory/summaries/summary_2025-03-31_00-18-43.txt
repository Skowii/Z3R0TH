Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the code, defining desired behavior and leading to better quality code. It contrasts with traditional coding approaches by emphasizing testing first, followed by writing the actual code. Vitest, a popular testing library, can be used for TDD projects, providing useful features like matchers, mocking, and assertions without requiring much configuration.
