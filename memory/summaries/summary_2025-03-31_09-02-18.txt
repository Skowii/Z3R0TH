This code example uses the cosine_similarity library and spacy library's English medium-size model to compute the similarities between word vectors. It first loads the en_core_web_md model and then computes the similarities between different word pairs using the compute_cosine_similarity function. The words/vectors compared are "dog", "cat", "apple", "delicious" and "tasty". The resulting similarity scores are printed out.
