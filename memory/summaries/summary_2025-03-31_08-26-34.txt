The Servant design pattern in Java helps to decouple operations from object classes, enabling reusable and efficient code management. In this pattern, a "Servant" class provides specific services to multiple objects without altering their original functionality. This promotes efficient design practices in software development. For example, in the given real-world scenario of a restaurant, waiters serve as Servants who offer common services to tables without affecting the core nature of the tables or customers. In Java, the Servant class provides methods that cater to a desired service, and objects act as parameters for these methods. This pattern can be particularly useful when adding common functionality to a group of classes is not feasible.
