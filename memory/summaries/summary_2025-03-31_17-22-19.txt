The Condition Block is a logical component used to evaluate comparisons between two values, producing outputs based on the result. It takes two input values and a comparison operator, performs the comparison, and outputs a boolean value indicating if the condition was met. Optional inputs are provided for the yes and no output values, which will be displayed depending on the condition's outcome. The block can be used in various applications, such as loyalty programs, to determine eligibility based on conditions and provide relevant messages.
