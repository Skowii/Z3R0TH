Technical debt refers to the negative consequences of writing code without a proper understanding of the software or its requirements. It accumulates over time, leading to lower productivity, decreased code quality, and increased development effort. To deal with technical debt, one must identify its causes and symptoms early on, follow best practices, and improve communication among team members. Addressing technical debt can improve productivity, morale, and overall software quality.
