Create a custom textarea component in React with word or character limit by enhancing the functionality of the `<textarea>` element. The simplest version is an uncontrolled component that uses the `defaultValue` prop and the `onChange` event to fire the `onValueChange` callback, sending the new value to the parent. A controlled component uses the `value` prop to manage the input field's value and updates it with the `onChange` event. To add a character limit, use the `useState()` hook to create a `content` state variable set to the `value` prop trimmed down to `limit` characters. The `onChange` event binds to call `setFormattedContent` with the value of the fired event.
