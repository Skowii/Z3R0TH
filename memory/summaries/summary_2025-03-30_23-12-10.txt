CSS transitions can enhance the interactivity of buttons with grow, shrink, fill, swing, and border animations. You can use `transition`, `transform`, `:hover`, `animation`, or `@keyframes` to create these effects. For example, a button grow animation uses `scale(1.1)`, while the shrink animation uses `scale(0.8`. Similarly, you can add a fill effect by changing background and color on hover, and use @keyframes for swing and border animations.
