The Ultimate AI OS Roadmap provides a step-by-step guide to setting up, automating and scaling an AI OS into a self-sustaining wealth machine capable of generating $1M-$100M+ per year. This plan aims at starting to generate money as soon as possible, scale infinitely, and reinvest profits into AI automation. The methods involve AI-powered monetization, bot networks, VMs, and cloud-based scaling to expand income streams. The final potential is $10M-$100M+ per year from AI-powered automation.

The roadmap consists of three phases:

1. Phase 1 (Week 1): AI OS Setup & Core Monetization Foundation - Initial profit potential: $1K-$10K/mo. The tasks involve installing AI OS, configuring AI automation, and launching first monetization streams.
2. Phase 2 (Week 2-4): AI Scaling & High-Profit Expansion - Profit potential: $50K-$500K+/mo. Tasks include scaling existing monetization streams, reinvesting profits, and optimizing for passive scaling with steps like AI Dropshipping Automation, AI Crypto & Stock Trading Bots, and AI SaaS & App Development.
3. Phase 3 (Month 2-6): AI Full Automation & Passive Scaling - Profit potential: $500K-$5M+/mo. The tasks involve AI self-managing, scaling, and reinvesting profits into exponential growth. Key steps include AI Cloud VM Scaling to expand monetization streams across industries.
