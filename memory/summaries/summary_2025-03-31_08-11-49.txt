Feature Toggle Pattern is a design pattern in Java that enables dynamic management of features in production without deploying new code. It allows enabling or disabling features based on specific conditions, providing better control over feature rollouts and ensuring a stable user experience. This pattern can be used for various purposes like A/B testing, managing subscription-locked features, and gradual release of new features. The pattern has real-world applications in companies like Netflix, where it helps manage continuous innovation while minimizing risks. It also allows developers to use properties or user information to control the activation and deactivation of features at runtime.
