The Factory Kit is a creational design pattern that uses separate builder and factory interfaces to define a factory for creating immutable objects. It's useful in scenarios where a class doesn't know the type of object it needs to create, you want a custom builder instance rather than a global one, you explicitly define the object type, or you need to separate builders and creators. The pattern is mentioned in Design Pattern Reloaded by Remi Forax.
