The code defines a set of C++ source files using the GLOB command with RELATIVE flag for easier extraction. These sources are then passed through AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY to define the application sources. A loop is used to iterate over each file and replace ".cpp" with an empty string to get the executable name, which is then added as a target using add_executable. Set_target_properties sets the LINKER_LANGUAGE to CXX. If OpenMP_CXX is found, target_link_libraries adds the OpenMP library. The resulting binaries are installed in "bin/backtracking" destination.
