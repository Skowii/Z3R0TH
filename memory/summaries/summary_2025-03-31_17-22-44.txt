The Send Web Request block allows users to make HTTP requests to specified URLs with optional GET, POST, PUT, etc., methods and process the response. It then categorizes the response based on its status code into successful, client error, or server error categories. The block can be used in applications that need to interact with external APIs for various web-based interactions, such as sending user data, retrieving product information, or posting updates.
