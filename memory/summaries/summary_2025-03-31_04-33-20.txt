Ambassador pattern allows for helper service instances to provide functionality while decoupling from shared resources on the client side. It is useful for extending the network capabilities of older applications or those that are difficult to modify, and can be employed by professional teams for implementing desired features like monitoring, logging, routing, security, and elasticity without directly interacting with the application's core components. This pattern helps in reducing the overall client connection tasks and enhancing performance.
