When using React components, conditionally applying a className can be necessary based on various conditions. The incorrect method is setting a className based on a condition or leaving it completely empty. Instead, use null to avoid rendering uncommon and potentially problematic markup when no className should be applied. This ensures cleaner code and prevents issues with CSS selectors.
