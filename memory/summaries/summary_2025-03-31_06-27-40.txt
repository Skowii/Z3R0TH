Combinator category is about organizing libraries and archives that are focused on combining different components. In computer science, combinators are functions that can compose other functions to build more complex functions. A simple example would be a function `combinator not` which takes another function as an input and returns the opposite result. There are four primary types of combinators: identity, primitive recursive functions, combinators for combining functions (like and, or, not), and combinators that construct more complex functions from simpler ones. In the given example, there is a functional interface to find lines in text with different combinators like `contains`, `not`, `or`, and `and`. These can be combined to create complex finders for specific queries.
