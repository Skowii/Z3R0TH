The Active Object design pattern separates method execution from invocation for objects residing on their own control threads, introducing concurrency through asynchronous method invocations and a scheduler to handle requests. It uses self-synchronization without using synchronized methods. This can be useful when implementing entities with their own thread of control and exposing their API without the actual execution.
