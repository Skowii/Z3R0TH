Add or remove an event listener in JavaScript using `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()` methods. Implement a reusable function, `on`, for adding event listeners with event delegation support by passing element, event, callback function, and options object containing target property to check if the event matches the target specified. Use the same signature for a consistent function call in defining `off` for listener removal. Return a reference of the custom delegator function from `on` to remove it using `off`.
