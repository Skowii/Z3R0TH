A JavaScript range generator using ES6 generators can produce a sequence of numbers. The simplest implementation starts at 0 and incrementally increases by 1 until reaching the specified end value. The output of the generator can be consumed step-by-step, all at once or converted into an array. Extending the basic version to accept start and step parameters allows for more customization in defining a range that begins at a specific value and increments by a specific amount.
