The Monostate design pattern is an alternative to the Singleton pattern in Java, ensuring that all instances of a class share the same state. Unlike the Singleton, it allows for multiple instances but ensures they have consistent data. This is achieved by using static fields within the class, where any changes to these fields will be reflected across all instances. The Monostate pattern is useful when you want to avoid global variables while still maintaining a shared state across multiple instances.
