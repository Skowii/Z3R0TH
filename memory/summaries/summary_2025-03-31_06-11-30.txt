Business Delegate is a structural pattern that separates the business logic from the presentation layer and connects them. This pattern uses interfaces to decouple the various layers in an application and allows for easy communication between them. It helps in understanding how entities are connected, know about their interactions, and interact with other business entities to build applications. The Business Delegate pattern is used in Java EE (Enterprise Edition) to manage dependencies between tiers of an enterprise application.
