Elements at specific point on the page can be found using JavaScript's `Document.elementFromPoint()` and `Document.elementsFromPoint()` methods. These functions allow you to retrieve an element or array of elements based on their position relative to a provided coordinate (x, y). The methods work seamlessly with iframes as well, making it a handy tool for pointer events and other user input-related tasks.
