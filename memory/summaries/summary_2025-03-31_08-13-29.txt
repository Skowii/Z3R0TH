The Composite View design pattern in Java aims to manage complex hierarchical views by composing objects into tree structures, representing part-whole hierarchies. This allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, simplifying the management of complex views. A real-world example is a financial dashboard with various widgets, where the Composite View pattern enables easy reorganization, addition of new widgets, and consistent management of layout. The pattern involves a main view being composed of smaller subviews, following a template-based approach, and using a view manager to decide which subviews to include in the template. In Java, this can be implemented with Tomcat 10+ using an `HttpServlet` that runs on a server.
