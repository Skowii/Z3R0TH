The Memento design pattern in Java allows developers to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. This pattern is ideal for undo functionality in applications, such as a text editor. It involves capturing the current state of an object each time it changes, saving it as a memento in a history list. When the user clicks "undo," the application restores the object to its previous state without exposing or altering internal data structures. This pattern is useful for real-world applications, such as astrology software that captures and restores star objects' states.
