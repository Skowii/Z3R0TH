This article provides a basic technique for creating a typographic scale using CSS. The process involves selecting a font family, setting a starting font size, and choosing a scaling factor. Typically, Roboto is chosen as the font family, with a 18px initial font size and a ratio of 1.618. With these variables established, the basis for the typographic scale is created. By multiplying or dividing by the ratio, different font sizes can be applied to headings and footnotes, providing a visual hierarchy. Using font weights can further emphasize certain elements. This technique offers a strong foundation for building custom typographic scales based on individual preferences and design requirements.
