The script uses a ChromaDB with OpenAI integration to analyze and query car reviews. It first queries for positive reviews based on the given rating threshold, then creates an OpenAI-generated summary of those good reviews. Afterwards, it queries for poor reviews, also based on a specified rating threshold, and requests a worst review analysis from the AI. The code then prints out the summaries as well as the generated response for the worst review.
