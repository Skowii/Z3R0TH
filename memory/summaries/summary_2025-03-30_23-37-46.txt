Understand how events work in JavaScript and learn when to use bubbling, capturing, and delegation with this short guide. Event bubbling means events propagate from the target element up through its ancestor tree, while capturing is the opposite, starting from the root element and moving down. Event delegation involves listening for events on parent elements instead of adding event listeners directly to targets. This allows a single listener to handle multiple elements with similar behaviors.
