This guide explains JavaScript naming conventions for variables, functions, constants, classes, and private members:

1. Variables should be lowercase with `camelCase`, descriptive and self-explanatory.
2. Functions follow the same rule, using verbs in imperative form and common prefixes like 'get' or 'has'.
3. Constants can use either `camelCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
4. Class names start with a capital letter and use `PascalCase`, describing their functionality.
5. Components in frontend frameworks follow these rules.
6. Private members should be prefixed with an underscore, though this doesn't prevent access from other parts of the code.
