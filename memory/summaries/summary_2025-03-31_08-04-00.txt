The Service Locator pattern is a Java design pattern that simplifies dependency management by using a central service registry. It decouples clients from service implementations, ensuring convenience and efficiency. A real-world example is a concierge desk at a hotel, which handles guest requests without the guests directly interacting with service providers. In Java, the Service Locator class retrieves and caches services via the Service interface.
