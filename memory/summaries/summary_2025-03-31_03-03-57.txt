Identity Map pattern in Java is a design pattern used for efficient object management and preventing duplicates in memory. This pattern improves performance by loading each unique object only once into a central registry, which is then reused throughout the application. Real-world examples involve organizing a conference where attendee details are entered and retrieved efficiently to avoid confusion or when accessing data from a database. Java implementation example includes creating an `IdentityMap` class that maintains a mapping between object identities and their corresponding objects, ensuring only one instance of each unique object is created in memory.
