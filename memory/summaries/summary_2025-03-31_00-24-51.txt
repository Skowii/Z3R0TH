Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding state changes and mutable data. It emphasizes using pure functions and immutability concepts to solve problems in a functional way. Some key FP concepts include:

1. Pure functions: Functions that always return the same output for the same input, without side effects.
2. Immutability: Once created, a value cannot be changed (unlike mutable data).
3. Higher-order functions: Functions that either take another function as an argument or return a new function.
4. Recursion: A technique where a function calls itself to solve problems.

Benefits of functional programming include improved code reasoning, easier testing and debugging, and increased readability and maintainability.
