The article explains how to find the insertion index of an element in a sorted JavaScript array. To do this, one can use `Array.prototype.findIndex()` or `Array.prototype.findLastIndex()` along with checking if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order. For more complex data like arrays of objects, a comparator function can be used to determine the insertion index.
