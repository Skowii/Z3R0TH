Set operations can be applied to JavaScript `Set` objects and arrays using mathematical functions like union, intersection, and difference. Union is used for elements that exist in any of the two sets, intersection for elements that exist in both sets, and difference for elements that exist only in the first set. Symmetric difference is used for elements that exist in either set but not in both. These operations can be easily adapted to work with arrays or other iterables, providing performance optimizations depending on the use-case.
