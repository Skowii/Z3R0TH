Cutout effects are a visually appealing technique to create unique layouts and highlight content in websites. By using an image cutout, CSS can be employed to achieve this effect. A container element with a colored background is needed along with a card element containing the desired image. The pseudo-element `::before` is used to add a border matching the container's background, creating the illusion of a cutout. This example demonstrates how to apply this technique using HTML and CSS.
