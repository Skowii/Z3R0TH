This article discusses how to encode and decode strings with Base64 in JavaScript. The `btoa()` method is used to encode a string into its Base64-encoded equivalent, while the `atob()` function decodes the encoded string back to its original form. Both functions are supported in modern browsers and Node.js versions 16.0.0 or higher. For older Node.js versions, custom `btoa()` and `atob()` functions can be created using the `Buffer` class.
