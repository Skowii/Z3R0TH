The Composite Pattern is a design pattern in Java that helps create flexible tree structures representing part-whole hierarchies, enabling clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. It is suitable for applications like graphical user interfaces, file systems, and organizational structures. By using the Composite Design Pattern, it allows clients to perform operations consistently on both individual elements and groups of elements in tree structures. In Java, a base class called `LetterComposite` is created with methods to handle printable types such as `Word` and `Sentence`, allowing users to treat these objects interchangeably.
