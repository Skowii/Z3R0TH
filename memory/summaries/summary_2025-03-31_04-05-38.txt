Observer, also known as the "观察者" in Chinese, is a behavioral design pattern that lets multiple objects observe and react to changes in another object without making them dependent on each other. It is used when an object's state needs to be updated automatically for other interested parties. This pattern separates the observer from the observable subject and provides loose coupling between them, allowing for easier maintainability and reuse of code. In Java, this can be achieved using the java.util.Observer interface.
