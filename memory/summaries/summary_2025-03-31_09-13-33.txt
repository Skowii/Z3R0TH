This is a Hangman game implementation. The player chooses a word from the provided file, and the target word is hidden with underscores representing missing letters. Players take turns guessing a letter, and if it's correct, an underscore is replaced with the guessed letter. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses or all letters are guessed correctly, the game ends. The program prints the current status of the hidden word, guessed letters, and a cartoon character representing the progress of the hanging man based on the number of wrong guesses.
