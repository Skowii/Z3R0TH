The benchmark report shows an Auto-GPT agent tested on various challenges. The benchmark started at 2023-08-23T08:13:41+00:00 and ended at 2023-08-23T08:29:04+00:00. It completed the tests with a run time of 920.75 seconds. The agent passed all tasks, including "TestWriteFile", "TestSearch", "TestReadFile", and "TestPlanCreation". The highest task difficulty was basic: 2. The test results show a success rate of 100% for each task, but the "TestReadFile" reached its cutoff time, meaning the agent didn't complete it in the given time frame.
