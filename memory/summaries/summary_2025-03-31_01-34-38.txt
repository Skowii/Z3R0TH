This information is about colorizing text in Node.js terminal using special Unicode characters. You can use these characters to print text in color in the console which can be useful for adding emphasis or making logs easier to read. A table of common colors and their corresponding Unicode characters is provided. To apply these, a function that takes a string and returns it with the appropriate color code added is used. This involves template literals and adding special characters to reset background color at the end of the string if needed.
