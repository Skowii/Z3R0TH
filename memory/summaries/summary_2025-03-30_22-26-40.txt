Advanced React state hooks explore advanced state management techniques beyond the basic `useState()` and `useReducer()` hooks. This information presents two example hooks: `useToggler` and `useMap`. The `useToggler` hook creates a boolean state variable that can be toggled, while the `useMap` hook creates a stateful Map object with manipulating functions. These hooks allow for more complex state management in React applications.
