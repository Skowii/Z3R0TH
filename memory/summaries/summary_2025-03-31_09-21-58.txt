This code provides two functions to calculate the cumulative income of products. The first, "loop_cumsum", iterates through a data frame's rows and adds the product's sales multiplied by its unit price to a running total. The second, "pandas_cumsum", applies a lambda function for the income calculation and uses pandas' cumsum method for the same result. Both functions return the original data frame with added columns for cumulative income, though the latter is more efficient. The code demonstrates both methods using a data frame with 1000 rows, and times each method's execution using the "Timer" module from "codetiming".
