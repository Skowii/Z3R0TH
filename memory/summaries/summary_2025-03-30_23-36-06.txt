The JavaScript Proxy object is a language feature introduced in ES6, based on the software design pattern. It creates a wrapper for another object, intercepting and redefining fundamental operations performed on that object. Using traps, it allows customization of the target object's behavior. Examples of traps include `get()`, `set()`, `has()`, `apply()`, and more. A simple example demonstrates how to use a Proxy with the get trap to return null if a property doesn't exist in the target object.
