Tooltips, alerts and modals are essential dialog components for user interaction in React. They provide feedback, warnings or additional information to users. To implement tooltips, use the `useState()` hook to manage the state of the tooltip and set the visibility based on hover events. For alerts, use the `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks to control the display state, handle animations and closures using a timeout function.
