This article discusses how to compare two objects in JavaScript using various techniques. Even though arrays and objects are compared by reference, they can't be considered equal using equality operators like `==` or `===`. JSON.stringify may have pitfalls when comparing serialized strings. To implement deep equality comparison, one can use recursion for accounting nesting levels. This involves checking identical values, handling Date objects, and employing Object.keys() with Array.prototype.every().
