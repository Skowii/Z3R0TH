The provided folder contains four Python profiling examples: `time`, `timeit`, `cProfile`, and `pyinstrument`. These examples demonstrate different methods for identifying performance bottlenecks in a Python code. The `time` example uses the built-in time function, while the `timeit` sample employs the built-in timeit module. On the other hand, the `cProfile` example makes use of the `cProfile` library, and finally, the `pyinstrument` example utilizes the third-party pyinstrument library.
