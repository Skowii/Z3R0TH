This article explains how to create custom hooks for listening to events in React, using the `useEventListener` and `useKeyPress` hooks. The `useEventListener` hook allows you to add event listeners to elements and clean them up when unmounting. The `useKeyPress` hook is useful for listening to key presses on a given key, implemented with the `useState()`, `useEffect()`, and `addEventListener()`/`removeEventListener()` methods.
