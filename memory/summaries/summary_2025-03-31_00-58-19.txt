The binary search algorithm is a fast and efficient method to find an element's index in a sorted JavaScript array. It has a time complexity of O(log n) and requires the array to be sorted initially. The algorithm divides the search interval by half, narrowing down the possible locations of the element. Implementation involves initializing left and right boundaries, looping through updates based on comparisons, and returning the index if found or -1 if not. This implementation does not account for duplicate values in the array.
