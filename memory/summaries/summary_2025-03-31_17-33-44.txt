This document provides instructions for interacting with the project's Command Line Interface (CLI). It covers basic commands and their outputs, such as listing agents, setting up dependencies, starting an agent, stopping an agent, and working with benchmarks. The `agents stop` command terminates processes on port 8000. To get help for a specific command, add the `--help` parameter.
