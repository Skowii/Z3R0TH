Bytecode is a behavioral language that allows the definition of simple behaviors using data instead of code. It involves encoding a series of instructions, often in byte form, which are then executed by an abstract machine that interprets the data. This approach simplifies coding for game programming by allowing developers to update an entity's behavior directly without changing the source code each time they want to modify it. The documentation explains how a set of commands determine low-level operations and are transformed into a sequence of bytecodes, which the abstract machine then processes one at a time using intermediate data values. This allows for the definition of complex behaviors at a high level. For example, in a magic game, a Wizard class can be created to model the character's health, agility, and wisdom. Bytecode instructions can then be used to perform actions such as playing sounds or spawning particles based on these attributes.
