Truncate a string using JavaScript:

1. Use `String.prototype.slice()` to truncate the string to the desired length.
2. Add an ellipsis if the string has been truncated by appending '...' and accounting for its length.
3. Respect word boundaries by using `String.prototype.lastIndexOf()` and slicing the string at a whitespace character.
4. Implement locale-sensitive string truncation with additional complexities (difficult to solve).
