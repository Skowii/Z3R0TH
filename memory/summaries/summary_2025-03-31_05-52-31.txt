The Visitor pattern allows you to define new operations without modifying the existing code for elements of a class. It is used to separate algorithms from data structures, enabling changes in structure without affecting basic operations or adding new functionality. The pattern can be observed in the example of a military unit hierarchy, where the introduction of newVisitor objects enables interaction with different levels of military personnel (commander, sergeant, or soldier) without altering the underlying unit structure.
