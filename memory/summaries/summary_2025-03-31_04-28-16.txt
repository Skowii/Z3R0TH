The Producer-Consumer design pattern is a classic concurrency pattern that separates work and execution tasks to reduce coupling between producers and consumers. It's applicable when:

1. Decoupling system by dividing the work into production and consumption processes
2. Resolving issues where producing and consuming tasks require different durations
