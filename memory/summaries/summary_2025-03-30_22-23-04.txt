The Resource Preloading Cheat Sheet helps improve website performance by using various attributes in HTML tags such as `link`. `rel="preload"` downloads resources immediately, `rel="prefetch"` suggests fetching them in advance for the next page, and `rel="preconnect"` establishes a connection to speed up resource fetching later. Other options include `rel="dns-prefetch"` for resolving DNS, `rel="prerender"` for preloading and rendering resources, and `rel="modulepreload"` for preloading JavaScript module scripts.
