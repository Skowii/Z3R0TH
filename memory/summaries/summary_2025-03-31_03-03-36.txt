The Event Aggregator design pattern centralizes event handling in large applications, simplifying management and maintenance. It decouples event generation from event handling by collecting events from multiple sources and routing them to appropriate handlers. This pattern is also known as Event Channel, Event Central, or Message Hub. In Java, the Event Aggregator can be implemented using interfaces like `EventObserver` and classes like `EventEmitter`, enabling efficient communication between event sources and handlers through a central point.
