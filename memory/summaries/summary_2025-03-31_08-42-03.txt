The code estimates Pi using a Monte Carlo method with points uniformly distributed in the unit circle. It calculates the average distance of these points to the origin and multiplies it by 4 to approximate Pi. It then repeats this process for different values of n (number of points) and prints the results. A profiler is used to measure the execution time of the function with a specific interval.
