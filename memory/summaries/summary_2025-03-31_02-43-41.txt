Recursion is a programming concept that involves functions calling themselves repeatedly until they reach a base case. It's useful for solving problems where solutions depend on smaller instances of the same problem. In JavaScript, recursive functions continue calling themselves until the base case returns a result, allowing previous calls to function to return a solution. An example using the Fibonacci sequence demonstrates how recursion works, but it can be more efficient to use iteration for some problems.
