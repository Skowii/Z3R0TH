Builder Pattern: A creational pattern in Java used to simplify object construction by separating the construction process from its representation. This allows for complex objects to be created with numerous parameters and specifications while avoiding constructor pollution. The builder pattern helps solve the telescoping constructor antipattern, where constructors grow too long and difficult to understand. By using a Builder interface, multiple object types can be created through the same construction process based on specified attributes.
