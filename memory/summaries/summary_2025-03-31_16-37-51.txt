The content discusses the registration of handlers in message buses. There are two options considered: automatically registering handlers in all buses and explicitly declaring where a bus should be registered. It is decided that explicitly declaring where a bus should be registered is preferable, as it leaves more options for end users without forcing them to use specific settings. This decision also allows for easier adjustments in the future.
