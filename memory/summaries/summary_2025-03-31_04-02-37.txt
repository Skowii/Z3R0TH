The AbstractDocument class aims to provide extensibility in a non-template typed language and achieve the same with a type system that uses interfaces. This class represents a flexible document object that can be extended by implementing different interfaces, such as HasType, HasPrice, and HasModel. These interfaces allow access to specific properties of an object without needing explicit type declarations. The Document class serves as a base interface for defining an abstract document and provides methods like put(), get(), and children() to interact with key-value pairs stored in the object. An enum Property is used to identify different types, such as parts, type, price, and model.
