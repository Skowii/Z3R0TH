The Information Retrieval Challenge B requires an agent to find and write down the names, affiliated universities, and discoveries of Nobel Prize winners in Physics for 2010. It aims to test the agent's ability to retrieve related information consistently without using Google. The agent should pass this test after two cycles: one for retrieving information and another for writing the file, making it the hardest part of the challenge.
