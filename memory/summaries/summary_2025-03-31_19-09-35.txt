The Auto-GPT benchmarking test was completed on August 15, taking 2023. With a runtime of 120.2 seconds, the agent's tasks included writing a text file and reading a text file, both requiring "interface" skills. Additionally, a task involved generating a plan based on booking a flight to Toronto, which was successful at "basic" difficulty. Another task tested if an llm can search, but it failed. The tests were conducted using a specific agent git commit version, along with a benchmark git commit version.
