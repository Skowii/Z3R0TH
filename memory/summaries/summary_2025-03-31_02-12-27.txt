To reload a web page using JavaScript, you can simply use the `window.location.reload()` method. This function works similarly to the browser's refresh button, following the same cache rules. However, note that Firefox once supported an optional `forceGet` boolean argument in this function for bypassing the browser's cache. 

If you want to clear POST data from forms during reload, you can assign `window.location.href` to itself instead. This technique also comes with a caveat - if the current URL contains a hash, the page won't reload. In such cases, use `String.prototype.split()` to remove the hash from the URL before reassigning it.

Overall, `window.location.reload()` is the most common and reliable method for reloading a web page in JavaScript.
