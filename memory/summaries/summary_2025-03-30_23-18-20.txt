In Python, properly closing files is crucial. One approach is to explicitly call `close()` after processing the file, but this can lead to issues if an exception occurs before calling `close()`, leaving the file open. To mitigate this, encapsulate the `write()` call in a `try` statement and use `finally` to close the file, or use a `with` statement which ensures closure upon code completion regardless of exceptions.
