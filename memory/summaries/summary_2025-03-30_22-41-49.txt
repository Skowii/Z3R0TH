The author is facing the challenge of managing community contributions and content creation for their project. They struggle with providing constructive feedback on poorly written pieces and prioritizing high-quality content over irrelevant additions. As a result, they have decided to focus more on being a content creator rather than a curator, as this offers higher returns. However, they will still welcome fixes, discussions, and improvements to existing content. New community contributions, especially low effort ones, may be auto-closed in the future. The author hopes contributors find other communities where they can receive proper recognition.
