Compacting an array or object in JavaScript involves removing all falsy values using the Boolean function. For arrays, use `arr.filter(Boolean)`. For objects, iterate over the object with `Object.entries()` and filter key-value pairs using `(key, value) => Boolean(value)`. To deeply compact nested arrays or objects, use recursion along with `Array.isArray()`, `Boolean()`, and `typeof` functions to iterate and check truthiness of each value.
