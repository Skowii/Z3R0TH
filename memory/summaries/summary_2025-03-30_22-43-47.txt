Use the `git log` command to filter commits based on various criteria, such as viewing all commits within a specific date range using `git log --since=<date-from> --until=<date-to>`. The dates can be specified in multiple formats or relative terms like yesterday or 2 weeks ago. Options for limiting commits include:
- Between two dates: `--since=<date-from> --until=<date-to>`
- Since a specific date: `--since=<date-from>`
- Until a specific date: `--until=<date-to>`
