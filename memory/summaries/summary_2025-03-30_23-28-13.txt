Throttle is a technique used to limit the number of times a JavaScript function is called. It ensures the function is only invoked once every specific amount of time, using `setTimeout()`, `clearTimeout()`, and `Date.now()`. To prevent race conditions, a variable, `inThrottle`, is used. The throttled function can be applied with `Function.prototype.apply()` and the necessary arguments.
