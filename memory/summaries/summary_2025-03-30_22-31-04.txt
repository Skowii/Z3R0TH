The useScript hook in React allows you to dynamically load an external script in a component. To do this, create a state variable using the useState() hook and define a function using the useEffect() hook that loads and unloads the script based on the src value. Check if a relevant <script> element exists, and if not, create one with the appropriate attributes. Listen for 'load' and 'error' events and handle them by updating the data-status attribute and status state variable. Remove any listeners bound to the element when the component unmounts. Be cautious about loading external scripts as they can introduce security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
