To merge two arrays in JavaScript, use either the spread operator (`...`) or the `Array.prototype.concat()` method. The spread operator is more concise and slightly faster, but may cause issues with non-array values. In contrast, `Array.prototype.concat()` can better handle mixed input types without errors. Choose the appropriate method based on your specific use case and desired output.
