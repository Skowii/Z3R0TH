This information describes a process to automatically extract executable names and compile C++ source files. It uses the RELATIVE flag, which simplifies the extraction of executable names, and iterates through a list of source files (APP_SOURCES) using a foreach loop. For each file, it generates an executable with its base name, sets the target language as C++, checks for OpenMP_CXX, and installs the targets in a "bin/strings" destination.
