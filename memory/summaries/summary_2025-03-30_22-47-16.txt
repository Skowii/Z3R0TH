Learn how to use Git's `git grep` command to search for matching patterns across your entire repository, its history, and specific branches or commits. This powerful tool supports regular expressions and allows limiting results by file extension or directory. The syntax includes: `git grep <pattern>`, `git grep <pattern1> --or <pattern2>`, and `git grep -i <pattern>` for case-insensitive search.
