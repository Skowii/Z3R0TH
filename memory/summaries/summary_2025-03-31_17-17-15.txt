The Google Maps Search block is used to find local businesses using the Google Maps API. It takes search queries, location details, and API credentials as input. With these details, it communicates with the API to fetch relevant place information, processing and returning structured data. This can be helpful for travel planning applications to discover popular restaurants, attractions, or accommodations in a user's destination city.
