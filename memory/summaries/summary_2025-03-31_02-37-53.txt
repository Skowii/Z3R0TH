Native JavaScript data structures include arrays, sets, and maps. Arrays are a linear collection of elements that can contain any valid type. Sets store unique values in an ordered manner, allowing each value to occur only once. Maps use keys for associating with values, where keys must be unique and either primitive or objects. These data structures come with various methods for manipulation and transformation.
