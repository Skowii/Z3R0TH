Agents Agent is an important part of the AutoGPT system, which uses components to execute pipelines and additional logic. The base class for all agents is `BaseAgent`, which provides essential logic for collecting components and executing protocols. Key methods in `BaseAgent` include propose_action and execute. The AutoGPT agent is a subclass of `BaseAgent` with built-in components. To create your own agent, extend the Agent class and add additional components to reuse existing components and default logic for protocols.
