The Subclass Sandbox Pattern in Java allows subclasses to customize specific behaviors within a predefined algorithm structure provided by the superclass, enhancing code reusability and extensibility. This design pattern is ideal for game development and extending class behavior, providing flexibility while maintaining a consistent process.
