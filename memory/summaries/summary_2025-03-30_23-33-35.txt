This article discusses refactoring a JavaScript project using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The main goals of the refactoring process are to reduce complexity, make the code less error-prone, and improve maintainability while keeping readability at about the same level. By taking a closer look at the code and simplifying redundant parts, the author was able to make the codebase more manageable. Some unnecessary options objects were removed during this process. The refactored library now has a smaller bundle size, down from 6.04 kB (1.63 kB gzipped).
