Logo guidelines include various formats: Regular, Monochrome, Grayscale, and with Background. The placement guide specifies the free space around the logo based on the inner circle of the letter "3". For small use, ensure a minimum width of 30px in digital applications or approximately 1cm in print. Misuse should be avoided by not cropping, rotating, inverting, or distorting the logo, and not using other colors or adding outlines, shadows, or glows. Additionally, avoid placing the logo against busy backgrounds or hard-to-distinguish ones.
