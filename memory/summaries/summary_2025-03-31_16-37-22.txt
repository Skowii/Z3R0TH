The content discusses the development of an API for product options, specifically focusing on how to efficiently handle product option values. Two possible solutions are considered: embedding values as objects within the ProductOption resource or providing them via Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs). It is decided that values should always be provided with IRIs, as this allows them to exist separately from the ProductOption resource and results in a more manageable response.
