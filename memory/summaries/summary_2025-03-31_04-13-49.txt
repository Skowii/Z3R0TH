Bytecode is a method that allows encoding behavior as virtual machine instructions, making it data-driven rather than code-driven. It supports high-level behavior by composing low-level operations through an instruction set defined in byte sequences and executed one at a time on the stack. This approach simplifies the process of modifying complex behaviors without needing to change the code itself, useful for game programming where multiple iterations of testing are common.
