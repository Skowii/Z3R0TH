The AG Benchmark tool was used to test the AI agent's abilities in various tasks such as writing to a file, code generation (two-sum and three-sum functions), searching text, and reading/writing a file. In all tests, the difficulty level ranged from interface to advanced. While some tests were successful, others experienced failures or timeouts, indicating that the AI still has room for improvement in these tasks.
