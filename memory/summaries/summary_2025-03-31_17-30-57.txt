AutoGPT Classic is an LLM-powered generalist agent that can execute various tasks across multiple disciplines on a computer. It is designed to iteratively and incrementally work towards its objective, giving users the ability to authorize each action. However, it aims to provide more autonomy in the future. The project consists of four main components: Agent, Benchmark, Forge, Frontend, and CLI at the root. AutoGPT Classic is part of the AutoGPT Platform that seeks to provide AI assistance to a wide audience and build the future transparently and collaboratively.
