Acyclic Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables adding new methods to existing class hierarchies without affecting their structure, avoiding dependency cycles of the Visitor Pattern in Gang of Four. It allows for extending functionality while maintaining the original codebase. In this example, ModemVisitor is used to check compatibility with specific configurations (DOS or Unix) without changing the modems themselves.
