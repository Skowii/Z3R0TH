Assigning default values for JavaScript object properties can be done using Object.assign() method. It involves creating an empty object, copying the original object, applying spread operator to combine default values, and overwriting properties with existing values. This allows assigning default values to all undefined properties in an object. Additionally, a factory function can be created for reusing defaults across multiple objects.
