Nesting elements with rounded borders can look incorrect if not done right. To achieve perfect nested border radius in CSS, calculate the outer element's border radius as the sum of inner element's border radius and the distance between them (innerRadius + distance = outerRadius). Example: For an outer box with 24px border-radius and 8px padding, the inner box should have a 16px border-radius.
