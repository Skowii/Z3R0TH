Acyclic Visitor is a behavioral pattern that allows new functions to be added to existing class hierarchies without affecting those hierarchies or creating problematic dependency cycles, unlike the traditional Visitor pattern from GoF. It enables adding new functions to existing class hierarchies without modifying them, enabling the creation of customized algorithms based on specific criteria. The Acyclic Visitor is particularly useful when it comes to extensibility in large software systems, as it prevents the need for unnecessary modifications and allows for more adaptability within complex architectures.
