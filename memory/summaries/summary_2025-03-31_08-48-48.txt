This code generates a sound wave using Python and writes it to an output .wav file. It sets the frequency to 440 Hz and the number of seconds to 2.5. The sound wave is created using the sin function, and the amplitude is calculated for each frame. The resulting data is then written to the wav_file in bytes format.
