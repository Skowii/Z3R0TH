AutoGPT uses a modular approach with various "blocks" to handle different tasks, allowing users to create complex automations by combining simple, specialized components. These blocks are categorized into Basic Operations, Data Processing, Text Processing, AI and Language Models, Web and API Interactions, Social Media and Content, and Search and Information Retrieval. Each block has a specific description and use case, making it easier for users to integrate these functionalities into their workflows.
