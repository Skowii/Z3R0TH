CSS pseudo-classes enable styling elements based on changes to their state. They are used for various purposes, such as applying styles related to content or user interaction. Some common examples include `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` for interaction feedback and `:link`, `:visited` for link styling based on navigation history. Other useful pseudo-classes include `:first-child`, `:last-child`, and `:nth-child()` for working with collections of elements, `:not()` for excluding specific selectors, and `:lang()` for applying language-based styles in multilingual websites.
