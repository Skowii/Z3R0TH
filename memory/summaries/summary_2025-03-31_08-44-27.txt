This code animates the waveform of a WAV file using matplotlib and pyplot, allowing users to specify the duration of each slide window. It parses command line arguments using ArgumentParser, opens the WAV file with the WAVReader library, and generates a series of animated plots based on the sliding window size. The code can be run as a script or incorporated into other projects for waveform visualization purposes.
