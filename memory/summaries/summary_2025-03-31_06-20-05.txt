Bridge design pattern separates the implementation from abstraction to allow independent changes to the two without breaking their relationship. It allows an object to be decoupled from its methods or algorithms by providing an abstraction and a concrete implementation. In the example, the Weapon interface is used as an abstraction while Sword and Hammer classes are implemented for different weapons with specific functionalities. Similarly, the Enchantment interface abstracts various enchantments which are then implemented in FlyingEnchantment and SoulEatingEnchantment classes. This design pattern enables flexible modifications to weapon functionality and enchantments without affecting the core interaction between them.
