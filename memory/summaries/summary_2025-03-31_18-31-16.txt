The benchmark started on July 30th at 8:11 AM and concluded at 8:12 AM, with a run time of 56.53 seconds. This test included four tasks. In TestWriteFile, an agent was tested for its ability to write to a file, successfully managing this in 5.792 seconds. Task two, TestPlanCreation, assessed the capability to generate content based on multiple files, which it managed successfully in 2.607 seconds. However, there were issues with GoalDivergence where the agent did not output the correct results, failing in 22.688 seconds. The last task, TestSearch, evaluated if an LLM could search and retrieve data from a webpage; however, this was unsuccessful as well.
