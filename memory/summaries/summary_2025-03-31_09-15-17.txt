This code is a function that generates a URL-safe base64-encoded token using the binascii library. It converts binary data into ASCII characters and encodes it using base64 coding while conforming to RFC 3548. The function takes in 'nbytes' as input, creates a random token, and outputs a dictionary containing the original token, its encoded version, translation, and base64 result. It is then used to demonstrate the mapping of the 'nbytes' to token length for different values.
