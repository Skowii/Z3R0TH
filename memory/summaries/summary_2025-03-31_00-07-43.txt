The text describes a method to merge two arrays of objects based on a unique key. By using `Object.values()`, `...`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()`, the process involves checking if an object has a specified key and combining it with any existing object having the same key, resulting in a single object for each unique value of the key property. The code example combines arrays x and y using the 'id' key to obtain a final array with all objects combined.
