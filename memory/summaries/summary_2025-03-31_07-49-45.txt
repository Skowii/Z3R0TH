The State Pattern in Java enables dynamic behavior change within objects as their internal state shifts, optimizing application responsiveness. This design pattern is used to represent different states as separate objects that define the associated behavior. The object, or "context," delegates actions based on its current state, allowing it to alter behavior when the state changes. Real-world examples include traffic light systems and mammoth moods.
