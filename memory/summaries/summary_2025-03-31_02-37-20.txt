Using JavaScript, you can listen and handle scroll stop events by adding a delay to the scroll event. You can achieve this by using `addEventListener()` for the `'scroll'` event, `setTimeout()` to wait for a short delay (like 150ms), and `clearTimeout()` to clear the timeout if another scroll event occurs within the specified time frame. This allows you to know when the user has stopped scrolling, which can be useful for lazy loading or performance optimizations.
