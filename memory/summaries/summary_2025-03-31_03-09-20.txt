The Collection Pipeline design pattern in Java simplifies data processing by connecting operations in a sequence using the Stream API. This pattern promotes a declarative approach where focus is on what should be done rather than how, improving code readability, maintainability, and performance. Real-world examples are similar to an assembly line in manufacturing cars, where each station performs specific tasks and receives inputs from previous stations. The Collection Pipeline pattern organizes computations as a sequence of operations that compose by taking collection outputs and feeding them into the next operation. This is analogous to function composition and can be observed in the example of filtering a list of `Car` objects based on their manufacturing year.
