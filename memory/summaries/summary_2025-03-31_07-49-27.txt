The Delegation Pattern in Java involves an object delegating tasks to a helper object, enabling code flexibility and reuse. In real-world examples like restaurants or printing systems, the main object can focus on overall management while specialized helper objects handle specific tasks. This pattern promotes efficiency, simplifies code, and allows for easy maintenance. In Java, this is achieved through an interface with multiple implementations and a delegating class that uses the interface to interact with the implementing objects.
