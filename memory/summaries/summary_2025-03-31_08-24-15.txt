Microservices Distributed Tracing Pattern enhances visibility into service communication by monitoring and tracking requests across different services in a microservices architecture, providing insights into performance, dependencies, and failures. Real-world examples include e-commerce platforms to identify bottlenecks and latency issues. Java implementation demonstrates how an Order microservice interacts with PaymentService and ProductService, generating distributed tracing logs for request flows and performance monitoring.
