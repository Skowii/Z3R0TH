The text explains the process of contributing to a documentation repository. Firstly, clone the repo and install dependencies. Use mkdocs server to view your changes in real-time. To add a new page, create a markdown file in 'docs/content', add it to the nav section in 'mkdocs.yml' and fill it with content. Check for broken links by running 'mkdocs build'. Finally, submit pull requests when you are ready to contribute your changes.
