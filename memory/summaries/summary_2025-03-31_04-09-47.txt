Commander is a design pattern for handling issues that may arise during the execution of distributed transactions. It helps in cases where database commits are not atomic and can lead to undesired consequences. In scenarios where transactions need to be performed on two databases, this pattern comes into play. The main idea is to have a coordinating entity (Commander) which ensures all steps are executed in a consistent manner without losing information or causing inconsistencies between the involved parties. This design can be applied when dealing with microservices and ensuring atomicity of transactions across them.
