The information provided discusses the process of validating a number in JavaScript, emphasizing the importance of doing so, especially when dealing with user input. The article mentions that while `parseFloat()` may seem sufficient, additional checks need to be made for `NaN`, `Infinity`, and coercion of the value to a number using specific functions and operators like `Number.isNaN()`, `Number.isFinite()`, `Number()`, and `==`. An example is given for a robust number validation function.
