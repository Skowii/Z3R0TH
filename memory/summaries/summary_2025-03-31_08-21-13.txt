The Table Module pattern is a design pattern used in Java for enhancing maintainability and simplifying database interaction. It encapsulates data access logic for a specific table, allowing developers to manage operations related to that table without exposing complexities to users. This pattern centralizes and handles the retrieval and manipulation of data while hiding the underlying database complexities.

The Table Module pattern is useful in real-world scenarios, such as managing a library's fiction section or a user login system for an application. In Java code, a class called `UserTableModule` can be created to manage all business logic associated with a specific table, like the users table. This helps simplify data retrieval and manipulation tasks.
