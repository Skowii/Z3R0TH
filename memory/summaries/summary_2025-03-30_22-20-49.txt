This information explains the process of listing source files and creating executables using CMake. The 'RELATIVE' flag is used to make it easier to extract an executable name automatically. Source files are globbed based on their extensions (either .cpp or .c) and added as targets with specified properties, including linker language and optional OpenMP libraries. Finally, the targets are installed in a designated destination folder ("bin/graph").
