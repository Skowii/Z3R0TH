Implementing signals and reactivity using vanilla JavaScript with event-driven programming involves creating a simple `Signal` class that extends `EventTarget`. The class has private properties for storing the current value of the signal, which can be accessed via `get` and `set` methods. The set method only updates the value if it is different from the old one and notifies listeners by dispatching a `CustomEvent`. To implement effects, a function can be provided to be called whenever any signal it depends on changes. This allows for reacting to changes in the system declaratively.
