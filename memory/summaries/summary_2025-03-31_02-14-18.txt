The article discusses a method for faster element removal in unordered JavaScript arrays. It mentions that `Array.prototype.splice()` is commonly used but not the fastest option. To improve performance, the order of elements doesn't matter, so swapping any element with the last one allows the last element to be easily removed using `Array.prototype.pop()`. An example is provided where a middle element is removed by swapping it with the last element and then removing the last element. The method can be an important factor in code performance, especially for large arrays or many operations.
