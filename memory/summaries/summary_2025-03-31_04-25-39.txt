The Active Object design pattern is used to decouple an object's method execution from its method invocation, introducing concurrency by using asynchronous method calls and a scheduler for request handling. It involves implementing classes with their own synchronization mechanisms without using "synchronized" methods. This allows objects to expose their API while having their own control thread. An example implementation in Java demonstrates how any class extending ActiveCreature will have its own control thread to execute and call methods. The Active Object pattern is often used for real-world examples like concurrent creatures that interact with their environment. A class diagram illustrates the relationships among classes in the design pattern.
