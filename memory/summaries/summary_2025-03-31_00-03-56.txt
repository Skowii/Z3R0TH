The K-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning method that groups a set of data into clusters based on proximity. In this JavaScript implementation, the K-means algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates centroids until convergence is reached. It uses the Euclidean distance to calculate distances between data points and centroids and checks for changes in previous iterations to determine if further iterations are necessary.
