The Observer design pattern in Java establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing an object (subject) to notify dependent observers when its state changes. This pattern promotes loose coupling and dynamic observer management. Real-world examples include news agencies updating subscribed news outlets or races like hobbits and orcs monitoring weather changes. The Observer interface allows for efficient event-driven programming, as objects actively monitor and respond to state changes.
