The Monitor design pattern in Java ensures thread safety and synchronization by controlling access to shared resources. It is a mechanism for synchronizing concurrent operations and preventing race conditions. This pattern can be seen in the `Bank` class example where synchronized methods are used to guarantee only one thread can perform transactions at any given time, making it an effective solution for real-world applications.
