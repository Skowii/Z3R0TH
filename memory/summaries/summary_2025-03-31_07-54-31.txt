The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern separates UI logic from business logic and data interaction in Java applications, enhancing testability and maintainability. MVP organizes code into three components: the model manages data and processes, the view displays information, and the presenter mediates between the two. This clear separation of roles allows for efficient application structure and development.
