The report details an AI benchmarking test with a completion time of 2023-07-25-04:00. In the tests, "TestWriteFile" and "TestReadFile" both have difficulty levels set at "interface." However, neither test reached their success cutoff. The task of "TestGoalDivergence" involved creating multiple .txt files, but it failed due to an assertion failure. The task of "TestSearch" was to search a given webpage and paste the text onto a .txt file, also failing with an assertion failure. Finally, the test "TestBasicRetrieval" aimed to retrieve specific website data but also failed due to an agent dependency issue.
