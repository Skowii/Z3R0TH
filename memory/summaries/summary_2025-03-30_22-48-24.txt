Git's "bisect" command helps find the origin of a bug in your codebase using a binary search algorithm. You can mark commits as "good" or "bad" manually or automatically, and the tool will find the commit that introduced the bug. For manual searching, use `git bisect start`, mark commits as good/bad with `git bisect good` and `git bisect bad`, and run `git bisect` to classify each commit. Automatic searching involves `git bisect start`, marking commits, and running `git bisect run <command>`.
