This CSS content-aware height transition method allows an element's height to be dynamically adjusted based on its content. It involves using JavaScript and CSS custom properties to transition the height from 0 to auto when the height of the element is unknown. By setting a --max-height variable and using Element.scrollHeight and CSSStyleDeclaration.setProperty(), the value of the custom property can be set to the current height of the element. The max-height is then adjusted on hover, with a transition applied for animating the height change. However, this method causes reflo on each animation frame, leading to lag if there are many elements beneath the element undergoing the height transition.
