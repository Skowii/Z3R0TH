In this article, we'll explore field validation for complex JavaScript objects, focusing on constraints such as type checking, empty and default values. The directory structure will remain unchanged, with updates made to the Model class and models to include field validation. This implementation is based on relational databases and ActiveRecord semantics. Fields can have types (string, number, boolean, date, or any) and can be empty or have default values. However, this setup may not be fully compatible with relational databases and leaves room for potential abuse in certain scenarios.
