To modify the URL without reloading the page using JavaScript, you can use the History API method by calling either `history.pushState()` or `history.replaceState()`. These methods allow you to change the current URL in the browser's history without causing a full-page reload. The arguments for both methods are similar and include a customized serializable state object, a customized title, and the desired URL. However, keep in mind that the History API only allows same-origin URLs. You can create a function to update the URL by simulating a navigation event without actually navigating to a different page using the `updateURL` function. This function takes arguments for the new URL, state object (optional), and whether to replace or push the new state in the browser's history.
