This optional section guides setting up a Google API key for use with the `google` command. To do so, create a new project in Google Cloud Console, enable Custom Search API and Custom Search Engine features, obtain your API key and search engine ID, and set them as environment variables in .env file. Note that the free daily quota allows up to 100 searches, and increasing this requires a billing account assignment.
