The Converter pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the conversion of data types between two entities in both directions. It separates the mapping process and reduces boilerplate code by introducing a double collection mapping, which makes it easier to convert one class instance into another. This pattern is applicable when there are type mappings needed and can be used with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
