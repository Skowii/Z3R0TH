The article explains the various methods to add key-value pairs to JavaScript objects. The most common and straightforward method is dot notation, followed by square bracket notation for dynamic keys, Object.assign() for merging objects, Object.defineProperty() for precise definition, and object spread operator (...) for non-mutative addition of properties. However, performance varies among these methods with dot and square bracket notations being the fastest, while Object.assign(), Object.defineProperty(), and object spread operator perform more slowly.
