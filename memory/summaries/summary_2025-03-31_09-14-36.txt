The `int.from_bytes()` function is used to convert a Python bytes object into an integer. It utilizes a base-256 numbering system for the conversion, and can be found in the random module's `SystemRandom.random()`. An example demonstrates how 1984 can be decomposed in a decimal system (base 10) as well as the base-256 system. The bytes_to_int function takes a byte array and a byte order ('big' or 'little') to convert it into an integer. The test function tests this conversion using random bytes generated by `os.urandom()`.
