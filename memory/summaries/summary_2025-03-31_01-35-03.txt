Maps and objects are similar but have differences that can aid in choosing the best option for a specific use case. Key types differ, as objects only allow string or symbol keys, while maps permit any value type. Iteration is more efficient with maps due to their built-in iterator support. Other differences include map's size property, `has()` method, and clear operation, which provide convenience in comparison to objects.
