CSS allows you to create horizontal or vertical scrollable containers that snap on elements when scrolling. You can set the `scroll-snap-type` property to `x` for horizontal, `y` for vertical, or `both` for both axes. You can also use the `scroll-snap-align` property to control the alignment of snap points with options like 'start', 'end', 'center', or 'none'. The `overscroll-behavior` property is used to prevent default browser behavior when reaching the end of the scrollable container, such as snapping back to the beginning.
