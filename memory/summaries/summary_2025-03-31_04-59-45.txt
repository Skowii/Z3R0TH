Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing test suites that divides tests into three clear and distinct steps: 1. Arrange - Set up the required environment and initial conditions; 2. Act - Perform the actions needed to be tested; 3. Assert - Verify the results of the action. This pattern provides several significant benefits, including a clear separation of setup, actions, and outcomes. It makes the code easier to read and understand. By following this pattern, developers can ensure their tests are consistent and maintainable.
