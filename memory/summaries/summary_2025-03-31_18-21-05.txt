This report is about the performance of an AI agent on various tasks. The benchmarking exercise was carried out using Auto-GPT Benchmarks with a git commit sha of e8a13867182ea352707ddef735c9145578fec309 and an agent from the Auto-GPT project, with its own git commit sha. The tasks include file manipulation (TestWriteFile and TestReadFile), search capability (TestSearch), planning generation (TestPlanCreation) and retrieval tasks such as content generation based on files' contents (TestBasicRetrieval). The agent demonstrated success in most of these tasks, although with varying degrees of difficulty.
