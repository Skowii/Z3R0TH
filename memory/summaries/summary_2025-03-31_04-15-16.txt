Data Bus, also known as Event-Bus, is an architectural pattern that allows communication between application components without them needing to be aware of each other. It enables a many-to-many communication and supports components deciding which messages to receive. This pattern relates to Mediator, Observer, and Publish/Subscribe patterns but further decouples publishers and subscribers.
