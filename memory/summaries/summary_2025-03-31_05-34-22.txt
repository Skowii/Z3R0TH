This project contains Java design patterns implemented in Java. The code is developed by experienced developers and architects from the open-source community, making it highly useful for those who are familiar with these concepts. The source code can be browsed through its high-level descriptions or by looking at the actual code itself. The examples provided are well-commented, acting as tutorials on how to implement a specific design pattern. The project utilizes popular and proven open-source Java technologies. Before diving into the content, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the [software design principles](https://java-design-patterns.com/principles/). All patterns should be as simple as possible, adhering to the KISS, YAGNI, and Do The Simplest Thing That Works principles. Complexity and advanced patterns should only be introduced when necessary for practical extensibility. Once familiar with these concepts, you can start exploring the [available design patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/).
