Detect user color scheme preference in JavaScript using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, combined with the `Window.matchMedia()` method to check if the user prefers a dark (`'dark'`) or light (`'light'`) color scheme. This can be useful for implementing dark mode features on websites and web applications. The default value is `'light'`, meaning it could also represent that no preference has been expressed by the user.
