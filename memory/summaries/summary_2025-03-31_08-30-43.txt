Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern in Java separates UI, presentation, and business logic, promoting cleaner code. It divides an application into three components: Model for data/rules, View for presentation, and ViewModel as intermediary between Model and View. This pattern ensures clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainability and scalability in real-world applications.
