Masking a JavaScript value involves replacing most characters in a string with a mask character. A helper function can be created to easily mask any value. First, convert the value to a string using a template literal. Next, use `String.prototype.slice()` to get the portion of characters that will remain unmasked. Finally, use `String.prototype.padStart()` to fill the beginning of the string with the mask character up to the original length. Optionally, specify the number of unmasked characters (default: 4), the character for the mask (default: *), and the starting position of unmasked characters (default: end).
