The difference between async and defer in script loading refers to how JavaScript files load and execute on a webpage. Using the "async" attribute, scripts load and execute in the background without pausing HTML parsing. However, they may not execute in the order specified. On the other hand, the "defer" attribute guarantees scripts will execute in order after the entire HTML is parsed.
