The code uses RELATIVE flag to list source files with executable names. It globally collects CPP files (APP_SOURCES) and iterates through them, replacing .cpp to get the name (testname). Each file is added as an executable target with CXX linker language. If OpenMP_CXX is found, it links the library for the target. The final step installs the targets in "bin/divide_and_conquer" destination.
