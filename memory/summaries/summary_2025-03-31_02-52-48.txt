JavaScript arrays can be initialized using different methods, including:

1. Array() constructor: Creates an array with a specified length filled with empty slots. However, this method has problems with handling holes or "empty" values and is not recommended for general use.
2. Array.from(): Converts array-like or iterable objects into actual arrays. It can also be used to create an array of a specific length by passing an object with a `length` property.
3. Array.prototype.fill(): Fills an existing array with the same value. This method can also be combined with the Array() constructor for efficiency and convenience purposes.
