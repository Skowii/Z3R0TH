The Naked Objects design pattern in Java aims to rapidly develop maintainable systems by directly representing all business objects and automating UI generation. By aligning the user interface with the domain model, it enables seamless updates and reduces development time. It focuses on three principles: encapsulating all business logic onto domain objects, having a direct representation of domain objects in the user interface, and automatically creating the user interface from domain object definitions. This approach allows for easy maintenance and quick adaptation to changing business needs.
