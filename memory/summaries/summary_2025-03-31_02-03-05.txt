When you call every() on an empty JavaScript array, it returns true. This behavior is due to the "vacuously true" property of an empty set satisfying any given condition. In contrast, some() method returns false for an empty array and any condition. This difference in behavior between every() and some() can be understood by iterating over empty arrays: every() has no elements returning false, so it always returns true; while some() will return false as there are no elements to satisfy the condition.
