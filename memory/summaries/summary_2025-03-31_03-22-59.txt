Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is a design pattern in Java that enables static polymorphism, improving efficiency and performance in applications. By having a class template derive from a template instantiation of its own class, CRTP allows method overriding and compile-time polymorphic behavior. The pattern helps manage different media types, such as books and DVDs, by providing common functionality while allowing for customization for each subtype. A real-world example demonstrates how a library system can use CRTP to organize various media types efficiently. In Java programming, the pattern allows classes to accept arguments specific to their subtypes at compile time, ensuring more efficient and type-safe polymorphic behavior.
