Caching is used to prevent expensive resource retrieval by retaining and reusing them after their initial usage, reducing the need for repeated resource acquisition. It is particularly useful when repeatedly obtaining, initializing, and releasing resources cause unnecessary performance overhead. This strategy involves saving resources in a fast-access storage area, allowing for better overall system performance.
