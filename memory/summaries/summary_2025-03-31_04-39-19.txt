Value Object, also known as 值对象, is a creational design pattern that provides objects with value semantics instead of reference semantics. This means that two value objects are considered equal if their values are the same, regardless of whether they are the same object or not. The goal is to promote immutability and simpler equality checks in objects. This pattern can be useful when an object's equivalence depends on its state rather than its identity.
