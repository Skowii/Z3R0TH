The Python code line if __name__ == "__main__": is a construct used to determine if the script is being run directly or imported as a module. When executed, it checks if the current file's name is set as "__main__". If true, the code within the "if" block is executed; otherwise, it is not. This can prevent unwanted side effects when importing modules and is especially useful in avoiding executing functions more than once in Python scripts.
