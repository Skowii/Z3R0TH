Idempotent Consumer Pattern in Java enables reliable and consistent message processing even when facing duplicate messages. This pattern guarantees that a message can be processed repeatedly without causing unintended side effects. Using unique identifiers, such as transaction IDs, allows systems to recognize and skip duplicate messages, maintaining data consistency and integrity. The pattern is useful in scenarios where message ordering is not guaranteed or duplicate processing would have significant consequences, such as payment processing or inventory management systems.
