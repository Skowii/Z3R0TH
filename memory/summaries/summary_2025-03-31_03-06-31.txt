MapReduce is a parallel processing design pattern used to handle large datasets efficiently. It divides work into two main phases: Map and Reduce. The Map function processes individual data points, while the Reduce function combines results. This allows for efficient parallel processing of data across multiple machines. Real-world examples include analyzing sales data or splitting and processing text data. In Java, the MapReduce pattern is implemented by separating the problem into smaller sub-problems and distributing them to worker nodes. The master node collects results and combines them to produce the final output.
