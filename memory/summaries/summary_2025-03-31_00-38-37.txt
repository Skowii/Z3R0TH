The difference between prefix and postfix operators lies in the resulting value of the expression. Both increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators add/subtract 1 from their operand. If used as a prefix (e.g., `++i`, `--i`), the value is updated first, and the final value of the expression becomes the updated value (e.g., i = 1, j = 1). If used postfix (e.g., `i++`, `i--`), the initial value remains unchanged, but the incremented/decremented value is returned (e.g., i = 1, j = 0).
