Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to produce groups of objects with similar characteristics by defining an abstract class or interface for the family in question, which acts as a blueprint. The pattern's main purpose is to decouple the creation of objects from their use and let the client use the objects without knowing the specifics of how they are created. It promotes reusability by separating the object instantiation process from the main logic.
