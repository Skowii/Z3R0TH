Extension Objects Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that aims to extend the interface of an object in the future. It defines auxiliary interfaces through extension objects. The pattern explains how to scale a program with unanticipated changes while minimizing the need for refactoring when merging additional features into a project. By using this pattern, developers can dynamically add functions to objects without modifying their core classes. This design pattern provides flexibility and ease in expanding or modifying the functionality of existing classes without altering their source code structure.
