To find the prime factors of a number using JavaScript, use trial division algorithm. Iterate over all possible prime factors starting with 2 and check if it divides the number exactly. If so, add the factor to the factors array and divide the number by that factor. Increment the factor and repeat until the number is 1. The implementation uses a while loop for iteration and returns an array of prime factors.
