The main difference between Array.prototype.map() and Array.prototype.forEach() in JavaScript is that map() returns a new array with the results of the callback function, while forEach() represents an iteration without returning any value. Both methods are used for array iteration; however, use map() when you need to return a new array with modified values or transformed data, and use forEach() when you simply want to perform actions on each element in the array without changing its structure.
