In this JavaScript implementation, partial search matching is built on top of TF-IDF and an inverted index for better document searching. Partial matching allows finding documents containing a substring of the search term while typing. This can be implemented using regular expressions to perform prefix searches. However, false positives may occur with simple prefix matching; hence, additional conditions are required. The first condition is only partially matching the last term in the search query, as it aligns with users' natural typing behavior. The second condition prevents false positives by skipping partial match if a full match exists in the inverted index for better relevance and faster results.
