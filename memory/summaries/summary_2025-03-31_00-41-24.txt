A linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next one. It consists of elements with properties 'value' and 'next', connecting them sequentially. Key operations include insertion, deletion, retrieval, clearing, and reversing the order. Implementation involves using an array to store nodes, with functions for accessing head/tail nodes, inserting/removing at specific indexes, and reversing the list.
