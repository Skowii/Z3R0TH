The "Send Email" block is a tool for sending emails using SMTP credentials. It allows users to send an email with custom subject and body, requiring SMTP credentials like server address, port, username, and password. The block connects to the SMTP server, authenticates, and sends the email. Inputs include recipient's email address, subject, body, and SMTP credentials. Outputs are email sending status and any errors encountered. It can be used in an automated customer support system for confirming received tickets and providing ticket numbers.
