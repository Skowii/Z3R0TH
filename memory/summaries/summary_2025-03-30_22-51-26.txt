The building block of Git's version control is a commit, which represents a unit of work saved in a repository. It includes changes to files, a commit message, and metadata like author and timestamp. To create a new commit, use `git commit -m <message>`. You can also skip pre-commit and commit-msg hooks using the `--no-verify` option or create an empty commit with `--allow-empty`.
