This tutorial explains how to join the segments of a URL using JavaScript, along with normalizing the resulting URL. The process involves joining the segments together using `Array.prototype.join()`, followed by applying regular expressions to ensure proper formatting and normalization. This includes removing double slashes, adding protocol-specific slashes, handling parameters correctly, and properly delimiting first parameters. A final function is provided as an example for joining and normalizing URL segments: ```js joinURL('http://www.google.com', 'a', '/b/cd', '?foo=123', '?bar=foo') // 'http://www.google.com/a/b/cd?foo=123&bar=foo'```
