The Ideogram Model is an AI-powered image generation tool that creates custom images from text prompts and various settings. Users can input a text prompt, optional parameters like model version, aspect ratio, upscaling, and style preferences to generate unique visuals. This block sends the request to the Ideogram API and returns the generated image URL as output. The block can be used by marketing teams for creating custom images without hiring professional designers.
