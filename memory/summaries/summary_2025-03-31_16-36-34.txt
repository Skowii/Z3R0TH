This is a template for the search page, which extends "layout.html". The title is set to "Search" and includes the JavaScript file "_static/searchtools.js". The footer block loads the search index using jQuery. The body of the page contains a noscript fallback message if JavaScript is not enabled, and displays the search results along with any error messages or context information.
