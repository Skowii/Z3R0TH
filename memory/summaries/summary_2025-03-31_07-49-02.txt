The Leader-Followers pattern is an efficient thread management and synchronization design pattern in Java that allows multiple worker threads to share resources, optimizing resource usage and improving system performance. It utilizes one leader thread that manages task delegation while worker threads wait for assignments on a rotational basis. This approach can be used in concurrent programming to improve CPU cache affinity, reduce event dispatching latency, and minimize locking overhead. A WorkCenter class can manage a group of Worker threads, with one designated as the leader responsible for receiving and processing tasks.
