Toggling an element in a JavaScript array involves removing it if it's included, or adding it otherwise. To achieve this, you can check if the element is present with `Array.prototype.includes()`, and then use either the spread operator (...) to add it, or `Array.prototype.filter()` to remove it. This ensures that the original array remains unchanged. The same approach can be used for arrays of objects by providing a comparison function.
