This Python guide explains two ways to convert a string to lowercase: str.lower() and str.casefold(). str.lower() is the standard method, but it may not be appropriate for Unicode strings. Python 3's str.casefold() offers better compatibility with Unicode strings, implementing case folding as described in [section 3.13 of the Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/ch03.pdf).
