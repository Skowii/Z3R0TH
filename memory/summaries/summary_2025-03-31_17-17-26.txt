The Read CSV block reads and processes Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files as input, splitting them into rows and columns based on user-specified delimiters, quote characters, and other formatting options. It outputs each row individually and the complete dataset. This block can be used in data analysis pipelines to import and process customer information or other datasets stored in CSV format.
