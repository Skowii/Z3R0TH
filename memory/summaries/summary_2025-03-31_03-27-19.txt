Leader Election Pattern in Java: Mastering Node Coordination and Consensus. This design pattern helps maintain consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability in distributed systems by electing a leader from a group of nodes. Real-world examples include team sports where a captain is elected to coordinate tasks, with failover mechanisms for leaders who are unavailable. Programmatically, the Leader Election Pattern can be implemented using classes like `AbstractMessageManager` and `AbstractInstance`, which manage messages between instances and find the next instance (leader) based on certain conditions.
