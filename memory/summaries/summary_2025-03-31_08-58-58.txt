Renamer is a class that allows for renaming multiple files. It takes in two parameters, 'files' and 'prefix'. This class emits signals such as progressed (to indicate the number of files renamed), renamedFile (the path to the new file name) and finished when all tasks are complete. The renameFiles() function loops through each file and renames them by adding a custom prefix with their original suffix, for example, "Prefix1", "Prefix2" etc. The class also emits a 'progressed' signal each time a file is renamed, the 'renamedFile' signal when a new file name is created, and finally the 'finished' signal when all tasks are done. This process can be made faster by removing 'time.sleep(0.1)' line.
