Python slice notation is used to return a list or portion of a list. The basic syntax is: `[start_at:stop_before:step]`. All three arguments are optional, and they represent the index of the first item (included), the element before which to stop (not included), and the stride between any two items. Slices can also accept negative values for `start_at` and `stop_before`, which means counting from the end of the list instead of counting from the start. A negative step value means that the list is sliced in reverse. Empty slices result in an empty list if the arguments' values are out of the list's range.
