The Layered Architecture pattern organizes software into hierarchical groups of tasks, with each layer interacting seamlessly while maintaining independence. This pattern is also known as N-Tier Architecture and can be seen in real-world examples like a high-rise building. It separates concerns into distinct layers such as data, service, presentation, and API, enhancing maintainability and scalability. A layered architecture diagram shows these separate layers interacting with each other, ensuring clear separation of concerns in software applications.
