The protobuf code generates a file called "recommendations.proto" that defines the RecommendationRequest and RecommendationResponse messages. The RecommendationRequest message contains user_id and book_category fields, while the RecommendationResponse contains an array of BookRecommendation results. There are three possible BookCategory values: MYSTERY, SCIENCE_FICTION, and SELF_HELP.
