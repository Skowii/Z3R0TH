The Strangler pattern is a method for incrementally migrating an existing system by gradually replacing specific functionalities with new applications and services. As the new system covers all functions of the old one, it can have additional features, effectively choking out the old system and allowing it to be retired. This pattern allows for safe and gradual replacement of systems, particularly when upgrading a legacy system using new techniques while continuously developing new features. However, it requires extra effort, so it's typically used when systems are not simple.
