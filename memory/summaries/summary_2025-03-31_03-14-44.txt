The Composite Entity design pattern is a structural pattern used in Java to manage interrelated persistent objects as a single entity. It is particularly useful in enterprise applications and EJB, simplifying complex data structures and client interactions. This pattern allows clients to treat these complex structures as one unit for simpler operations and interactions. A real-world example is a university registration system where the "Student" object includes personal details, course enrollments, grades, and payment information. The pattern enables managing these aspects together instead of separately. In programming, it can be applied with an abstract class called CoarseGrainedObject that uses DependentObject to represent a set of related objects as one entity.
