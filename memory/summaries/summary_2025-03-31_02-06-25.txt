Transform the keys of a JavaScript object by using various methods like mapping, deep map, and renaming. Map object keys with `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()`, and for nested keys use recursion. Deep map object keys by iterating through the object's keys and modifying them using a function. Renaming keys can be done using the spread operator (`...`) and a dictionary to match the new key names.
