To compare two arrays in JavaScript, use JSON.stringify to serialize each array and then compare the two serialized strings. However, this solution has edge cases where different values' serialized string is the same, leading to incorrect results. A better approach would be to compare the two arrays' lengths and use Array.prototype.every() to compare the values of the two. This method safeguards against the serialization issue described above but does not handle nested arrays or objects, which need to be checked recursively. For a more robust solution that handles these issues, check the relevant article on object comparison.
