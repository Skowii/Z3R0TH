The task involves pluralizing strings in JavaScript based on a number. A function decides whether to pluralize a word based on the number. For simple plural forms, the pluralized string is created by adding an _s_ to the end. However, there are exceptions such as _person_ becoming _people_. To account for these cases, an optional argument can be provided with a custom plural form. Pluralization can also be improved using a dictionary that stores the plural forms of words.
