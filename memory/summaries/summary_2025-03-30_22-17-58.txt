The code generates executable files from source files, using CMake's GLOB function with the RELATIVE flag. If not specified, it uses full pathnames for each source file. It extracts an executable name automatically due to the RELATIVE flag. Using AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY, a list of source files is created and then processed in a loop. In each iteration, a string replace is performed to remove .cpp from the source file's name and create a target with add_executable. SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES sets LINKER_LANGUAGE CXX. If OpenMP_CXX is found, it is linked to the executables. The TARGETS are installed in "bin/bit_manipulation" directory.
