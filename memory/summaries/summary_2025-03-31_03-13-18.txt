The Strangler Pattern is a design pattern in Java that incrementally replaces a legacy system by building a new system alongside the old one, allowing for a seamless transition. This approach mirrors real-world scenarios such as constructing a new bridge next to an old one and gradually redirecting traffic over time. The pattern wraps old code with new code, ensuring a smooth transition while minimizing disruptions.

Wikipedia further describes the Strangler Pattern as an incremental migration process that replaces a legacy system by gradually replacing it with a new system. It involves wrapping old code with new code and redirecting or logging uses of the old code to guarantee a seamless transition. The pattern is named after the strangler fig plant, which grows around a host tree and eventually replaces it entirely.

The Strangler Pattern is particularly useful for modernizing monolithic applications and transitioning them to microservices architecture with minimal risk and disruption. An example of the Strangler design pattern in Java involves incrementally migrating a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services.
