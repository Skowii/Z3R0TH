JavaScript's promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. Promises can be used for tasks like fetching data from a URL. The pending state switches to fulfilled or rejected depending on the success or failure of the operation. Handlers such as `Promise.prototype.then()` and `Promise.prototype.catch()` are called when either of these states are reached.
