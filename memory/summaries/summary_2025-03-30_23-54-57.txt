To split a JavaScript array into two groups, use Array.prototype.reduce() with a callback function determining which group each element belongs to. For known values, use an array of booleans as the filter. If the values are not known in advance, use a function that returns a truthy value for the first group or a falsy value for the second group. The resulting array will have two groups, with elements placed accordingly based on the given criteria.
