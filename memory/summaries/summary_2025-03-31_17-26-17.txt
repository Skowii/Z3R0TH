Commands are a way for agents to perform tasks or interact with APIs and tools. They are implemented by components that use the `CommandProvider` protocol. Commands can be created using a decorator, with parameters and descriptions provided in the decoration. Alternatively, commands can be created directly by creating a `Command` object and providing details such as names, description, method, and parameters. These commands can then be yielded in the `get_commands` function to provide them to the agent.
