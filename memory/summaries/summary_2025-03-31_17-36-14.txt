This code loads environment variables and credentials using the dotenv library, then decodes the base64 string into a JSON object. The code creates a list of rows called "rows" to store each row of data, which will be processed by a recursive function `process_test`. The function takes in test name, test information, agent name, and common data as arguments. It processes test data and appends the result to the "rows" list, checking for nested tests and processing them if present. Finally, it loops over each directory in the base directory (agent directories) and iterates through subdirectories to process test data.
