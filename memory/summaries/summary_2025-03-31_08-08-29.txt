The Collecting Parameter design pattern in Java simplifies method calls by aggregating multiple parameters into a single collection object. This improves code readability and maintainability, particularly for methods that collect information through numerous method calls. A real-world example would be using an order form at a restaurant to note down all items instead of separately noting appetizer, main course, dessert, and drink. In Java programming, this pattern enables better organization of data collection by having methods add results to a single collection object, rather than creating their own collections.
