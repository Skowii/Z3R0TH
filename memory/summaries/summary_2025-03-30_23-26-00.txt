The given information explains how to split a Python list into chunks. Two methods are described: splitting the list into `n` smaller lists or into lists of a specified size. In the first method, you calculate the size of each chunk using `math.ceil()` and `len()`, create a new list with `list()` and `range()`, and then use `map()` to map each element to a chunk of the desired length. The second method splits the list into chunks of a specified size, directly using the specified size for the calculation.
