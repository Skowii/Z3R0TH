The problem of finding the maximum contiguous subarray within an array of numbers is a common challenge in computer science. To solve it, one can use a greedy approach to track the current sum and the maximum sum found so far. Using variables like maximum start index (sMax), maximum end index (eMax), and current start index (s), along with initializing maxSum as -Infinity and sum as 0, iterate over the array and update sum by adding each element. If the sum becomes negative, reset it to 0 and update s to the next index. Update maxSum, sMax, and eMax if a greater sum is found. Finally, return the subarray using array slicing.
