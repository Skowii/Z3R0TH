JavaScript uses pass-by-value, meaning everything in JavaScript is a value type and function arguments are always passed by value. However, object types can be confusing as they are reference types passed by value. This subtle difference causes confusion and bugs for many developers. In an example using objects, if the original object is changed inside the function, it affects the original object; but reassigning the variable holding the object will not affect the object referenced by the function.
