The text above discusses how to type check for different types of streams in Node.js. It starts by explaining what a stream is and its general structure. The article then proceeds with specific examples on how to check if a given value implements a readable, writable, or duplex stream using the `_read`, `_readableState`, `_write`, and `_writableState` properties. These checks are in addition to the basic one that verifies if the value is an object with a pipe function.
