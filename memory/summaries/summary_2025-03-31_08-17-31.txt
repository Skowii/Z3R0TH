The Command design pattern is a behavioral pattern used in Java that encapsulates requests as objects to support decoupling, extensibility, and undoable operations. It separates control logic from device implementation for flexible command execution. A real-world example includes smart home systems controlling devices with stored commands as objects. In Java, the Command pattern is implemented by creating a Wizard class that casts spells on a Goblin using command objects, allowing execution and undoing of actions.
