Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a design pattern used in Java to ensure efficient management of resources by linking their lifecycle to object lifetime. This pattern helps with exception-safe resource handling, ensuring robust resource allocation and deallocation. Java achieves RAII using try-with-resources statements, `java.io.Closeable` and `AutoCloseable` interfaces. A practical example involves implementing the `AutoCloseable` interface in a resource class, where the constructor acquires the resource and the close method releases it.
