Git's fast-forward mode is the default method for merging branches, which places commits from the merged branch onto the main branch, creating a linear history. However, GitHub usually overrides this and creates merge commits instead to better track branches. The "Rebase and merge" option can be used to emulate fast-forward merge on GitHub. To change the default merge behavior in Git, use the `--no-ff` flag or configure `git config`.
