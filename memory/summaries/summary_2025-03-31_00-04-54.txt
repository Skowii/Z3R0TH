This article explains how to use negative indexes in JavaScript arrays using a Proxy. By defining a get trap handler for the Proxy object, it becomes possible to access array elements using negative indexes. The handler first converts the passed index to a number and calculates the actual position using Array.prototype.length. Then, Reflect.get() is used to get the value at the specific index, ensuring the second argument is a string.
