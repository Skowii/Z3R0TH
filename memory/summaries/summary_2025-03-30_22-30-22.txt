Lazy loading images in React improves performance by only loading images when they are visible on the viewport. To create a custom lazy loading image component, use the `IntersectionObserver` API along with the useState(), useEffect(), and useRef() hooks. Apply the 'loading="lazy"' attribute to the img element and use the isLoaded state variable to determine the value of the src attribute.
