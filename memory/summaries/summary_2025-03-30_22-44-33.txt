Learn how to quickly and easily reset your local master branch to match the one on the remote. To do this, first update your repository with `git fetch origin`, then switch to the `master` branch with `git checkout master`. Finally, reset it to match the remote using `git reset --hard origin/master`. This process can be used for any branch by replacing "master" with the desired branch name.
