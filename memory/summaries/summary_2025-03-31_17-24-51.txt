GitHub Issues is a suite of tools for interacting with GitHub's platform. The GitHub Comment tool allows users to post comments on existing GitHub issues or pull requests using the API, while GitHub Make Issue creates new issues in a specified repository with provided information. GitHub Read Issue retrieves details about specific GitHub issues, and GitHub List Issues fetches a list of open issues from a repository. These tools can be used for automating responses to issues, creating new ones, gathering data on reported issues, or listing existing issues within a repository.
