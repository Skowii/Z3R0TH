Implement the Fluent Interface design pattern in Java to enhance code expressiveness through method chaining, improving readability and maintainability. The pattern allows you to build complex objects step-by-step by sequentially chaining method calls. This approach is like specifying each part of a coffee order or selecting numbers based on different criteria from a list using the FluentIterable interface example.
