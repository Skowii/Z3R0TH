The Proxy Pattern in Java provides a surrogate or placeholder object to control access, facilitate lazy initialization, and ensure security. It can act as an intermediary between the client and the real object while providing additional logic and functionality. In this pattern, a class acts as an interface to another object, streamlining access control and operation efficiency. The Proxy design pattern is often used for decoupling, encapsulation, Gang Of Four, lazy initialization, security, and wrapping.
