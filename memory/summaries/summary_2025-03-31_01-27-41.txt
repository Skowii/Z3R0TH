This article discusses optimizing recursive functions, which are often inefficient or require optimization. It provides a few tricks to speed up recursive functions, such as memoization and dynamic programming. The Fibonacci sequence is used as an example for understanding recursion better. Memoization involves caching the result of previously computed function calls to avoid repeated calculations, leading to improved performance.
