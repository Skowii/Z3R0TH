Can I create dynamic setters and getters in JavaScript? Yes, you can use the Proxy object to create dynamic getters and setters in JavaScript. The Proxy object allows you to intercept and manipulate an object's behavior when a property is accessed or set using traps like 'get' and 'set'. This is useful for scenarios where the shape of the data is not known, or when certain conditions apply to values being accessed or set.
