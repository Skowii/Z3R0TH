The Dirty Flag design pattern in Java helps optimize performance by tracking changes in an object's state using a boolean flag. This pattern reduces unnecessary computations and resource-heavy operations by only performing them when needed, such as updating the object after it has been changed. Real-world examples, like tracking checked-out library books, demonstrate how this pattern minimizes effort and time required for maintaining object states. Java's implementation of this pattern can be seen in the DataFetcher class, which uses a dirty flag to determine whether data needs to be fetched from a file.
