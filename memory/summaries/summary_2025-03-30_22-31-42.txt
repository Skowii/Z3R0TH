Create your own star rating component in React by separating the individual star component (Star) and parent component (StarRating). Use the `useState()` hook to define state variables for rating and selection. Handle mouse over, mouse leave, and click events using methods like `hoverOver` and `setRating`. Use CSS to style the stars and create an array of 5 star components with Array.from(). This allows you to easily implement a star rating component in React.
