The Sylius/Locale library provides locale handling for PHP applications, focusing on language, localization, and internationalization. It is built on the MIT license, with contributions from various authors including the Sylius project itself. The package requires PHP 7.4 or 8.0, Sylius/Resource 1.7, Symfony/Intl 4.4 or 5.2, and Laminas/Laminas-Stdlib 3.2. It also includes tests using PhpSpec 7.0. The library has a dev-master branch alias and utilizes PSR-4 autoloading for class loading.
