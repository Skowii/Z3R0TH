The Circuit Breaker pattern is a crucial design pattern in Java that enhances fault tolerance and prevents cascading failures in distributed systems and microservices architectures. It helps ensure resilience by preventing a system from repeatedly trying to execute operations likely to fail, allowing it to recover from faults and prevent cascading failures. The Circuit Breaker pattern is particularly useful when components are highly decoupled, and the failure of one part doesn't affect the rest of the system. A real-world example would be an e-commerce website that relies on external payment gateways; this pattern can detect the failure and switch to alternative gateways or display error messages to the user. In Java, a programmatic example demonstrates how the Circuit Breaker pattern manages remote service failures and maintains system stability by simulating a delayed remote service and setting up the circuit breaker.
