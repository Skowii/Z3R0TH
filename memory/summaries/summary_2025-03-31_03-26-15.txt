The Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) pattern is a design pattern used in unit testing for Java. It simplifies and clarifies tests by dividing them into three distinct sections: setup (Arrange), execution (Act), and verification (Assert). This pattern helps maintain clear separation between the preparation, execution, and evaluation of tests, thus improving readability and maintainability. In real-world examples, AAA can be applied to organizing a small event where setup involves arranging the venue, guest list, seating, and catering; execution entails running the event according to plan, and evaluation involves checking guest feedback, tasks completion, and comparing the actual outcome to expectations. In Java programming, this pattern is applied by structuring tests with clearly separated steps: Arrange, Act, and Assert.
