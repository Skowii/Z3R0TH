A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of ordered nodes with at most two children each. It has the following main properties: key, value, parent, left child, and right child. The main operations include inserting, removing, checking existence, finding, and traversal through pre-order, post-order, and in-order traversals.

The implementation of a binary search tree uses a class BinarySearchTreeNode and a class BinarySearchTree. The class provides the methods for in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversal.
