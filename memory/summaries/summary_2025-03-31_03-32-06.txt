The Acyclic Visitor pattern is a design pattern in Java that separates operations from an object hierarchy, making it flexible for various applications. It's useful for adding new functions to existing class hierarchies without altering those hierarchies and prevents the creation of dependency cycles. Real-world examples include a museum guide system or a modem compatibility algorithm. The pattern is implemented by having each exhibit or object implement an interface, which allows different guide or algorithm types to visit them without modifying the original hierarchy. This makes it highly extensible and maintainable in real-world scenarios.
