The Extension Objects pattern in Java allows for the flexible enhancement of an object's functionality without modifying its structure. This is done by attaching additional objects that can dynamically add new features. This design pattern is also known as Interface Extensions. In this pattern, a base class, such as the `Unit` class, exists with methods like `getUnitExtension()`. Then, specific types of units are created, such as `SoldierUnit`, `SergeantUnit`, and `CommanderUnit`. Each of these can have different extensions that provide additional functionality, such as `SoldierExtension`, `SergeantExtension`, and `CommanderExtension`. This pattern is beneficial as it provides versatility and adaptability, allowing developers to extend or modify class functionality without having to alter the original source code.
