The code creates an AsyncFileIterable class that reads a file in chunks and returns each chunk in an asynchronous manner using async/await syntax. It uses the aiofiles module to open files asynchronously, allowing for efficient processing of large files. This is done by reading the file in specified chunk_size (default 1024) and yielding each chunk. The main function iterates through the chunks of a file and processes them.
