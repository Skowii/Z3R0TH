The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object, controlling access to it. It can be used to delay the creation of expensive objects, provide additional logic before accessing the real object, or control access to resources. In code examples, a WizardTowerProxy class is implemented as an intermediary between the Wizard and IvoryTower classes, allowing only three wizards to enter the tower. Proxy patterns can be applied in various situations such as remote proxies, virtual proxies, and protective proxies. They are often used for access control, lazy initialization, logging implementations, network connection enhancement, and object reference counting.
