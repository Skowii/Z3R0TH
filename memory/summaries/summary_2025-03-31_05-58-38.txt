The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the process of creating a complex object from its representation, allowing the construction of different representations of the object. It helps prevent code pollution by keeping the object's construction and its configuration separate. This pattern is useful when there are many steps in the process of creating an object or when various flavors of an object need to be created using the same process but with different settings. The Builder pattern acts as a solution for the Telescoping Constructor anti-pattern, providing a cleaner way to initialize objects by breaking down the construction process into smaller, more manageable steps using a "Builder" class.
