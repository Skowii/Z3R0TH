The Health Check pattern in Java is a crucial design for monitoring system health and ensuring reliability in microservices and distributed systems. It allows individual components to proactively report their health status to a central monitoring system for quick identification and remediation of issues affecting overall functionality. This pattern can be implemented using Spring Boot Actuator, which provides built-in health checks and customizable options for developers.
