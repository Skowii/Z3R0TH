Create a visual, non-editable prefix input with HTML, CSS, and ingenuity. Use two elements: a <span> for the prefix and an <input> for the input field. Style them accordingly for a visually appealing input box. Utilize the :focus-within pseudo-class selector to style the parent element when the user interacts with the <input> field, but ensure the prefix is included in form submissions.
