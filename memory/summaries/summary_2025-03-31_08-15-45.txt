The Retry pattern in Java is a design pattern that makes an application transparently retry failed operations involving external communications like network requests. This helps develop fault-tolerant software systems capable of handling transient failures gracefully. In real-world scenarios, this is similar to trying multiple times to deliver a package or make a connection. The Retry pattern in Java can be implemented using the `Retry` class, which takes a `BusinessOperation` and the number of attempts and retries the operation until it succeeds or reaches the maximum number of attempts.
