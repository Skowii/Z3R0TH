The Object Pool pattern is a design pattern that improves performance in Java by managing a pool of reusable objects instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly. It optimizes memory management and application performance by recycling objects, saving time and resources. Real-world examples include libraries managing study rooms or a game using oliphaunts as expensive assets.

A programmatic example is demonstrated in Java with an `Oliphaunt` class and an `ObjectPool` interface, specifically the `OliphauntPool`. The pool manages available objects and those currently in use, allowing for efficient reuse of expensive resources without constant recreation or destruction.
