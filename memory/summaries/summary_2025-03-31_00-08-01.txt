The ternary operator (?:) is a conditional operator in JavaScript used for replacing conditional statements such as if-else. It allows us to assign the result of a condition to a variable and can be used with arrow functions for implicit returns. However, nesting ternary expressions is discouraged due to readability issues. Ternary operators are often employed in React applications for conditional rendering in JSX code. The term "ternary" originates from the operator having three operands: condition, expression for truthy result, and expression for falsy result.
