Construct a URL in JavaScript by using the `URL` object which provides a more reliable and maintainable approach for encoding special characters and handling query parameters. This method is less prone to errors compared to template literals or manually encoding strings. The `URL` object allows for proper encoding, automatic delimiter addition, and can be used to change protocol, hostname, port, path, and other aspects of a URL.
