Builder is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It separates the object's construction from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different variations of the object. This pattern is useful when creating objects with many construction steps or when there are multiple variations of an object. By using Builder, developers can avoid the need for complex object initialization and can easily add new options in the future.
