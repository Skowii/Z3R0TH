The article discusses the importance of making line-height unitless in CSS. This is due to the fact that an inherited property like line-height will have different results when used with or without units. A unitless value will be recalculated for each element based on its font size, whereas a value with units will be calculated once and inherited as a fixed value. The use of unitless values can minimize repetition, but personal preference, codebase conventions, and design systems should also be considered when choosing between using units or being unitless.
