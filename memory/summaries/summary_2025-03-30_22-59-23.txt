This article explains how to create a custom responsive favicon that adapts its color palette for dark mode using CSS and SVG assets. To achieve this, use an SVG icon with minimal colors and two color palettes (one for light mode and one for dark mode). Leverage embedded styles in the SVG and the prefers-color-scheme media query to apply the appropriate color palette based on user preferences. Include the custom SVG favicon in the page's head element, and provide a PNG fallback with a rendered version of the icon in either palette.
