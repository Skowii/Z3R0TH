The Value Object pattern in Java creates immutable objects to represent a descriptive aspect of the domain without conceptual identity. This design pattern aims to enhance performance and reduce memory overhead by storing frequently accessed data directly within the object that uses it. In real-world examples, value objects are equivalent when their attributes have the same values rather than being the same object. A programmatic example using the Value Object pattern in Java involves creating a class for hero statistics in a role-playing game, such as `HeroStat`, which contains attributes like strength, intelligence, and luck.
