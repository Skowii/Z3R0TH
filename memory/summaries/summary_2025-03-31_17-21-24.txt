The Text Decoder is a tool that converts text containing special characters into readable text by identifying and replacing escaped character sequences with their actual representations. It takes input text, removes escape sequences, and outputs decoded text or an error message if there are issues during processing. This could be helpful when working with data from various sources where text might be encoded to preserve special characters.
