The Lazy Loading design pattern in Java delays the initialization of objects until they are needed, improving memory usage and application startup times. This technique is crucial for optimizing Java applications' performance. In real-world examples, such as a smart home with motion sensors controlling light usage, this pattern mirrors efficient resource management. Programmatically, this pattern can be implemented in Java using the App class that creates instances of various holders and retrieves the Heavy object from them when necessary.
