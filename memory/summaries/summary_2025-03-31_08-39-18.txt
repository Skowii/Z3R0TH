The code defines a function 'main' which takes args as input. It uses a bytearray to store the contents of a file read in binary mode using 'rb'. A while loop is used to read chunks of MAX_BYTES (1024) from the file, and add it to the buffer. An itertools.batched method is used to convert this buffer into rows with args.columns width each. Finally, the rows are printed as hexadecimal values. 
A 'parse_args' function is defined which uses argparse to parse command line arguments. The script reads a file path from the user and an optional integer value for the number of columns (-c or --columns). It returns the parsed arguments as a tuple. The script then calls main with the results of this parsing, allowing it to execute using the input provided by the user.
