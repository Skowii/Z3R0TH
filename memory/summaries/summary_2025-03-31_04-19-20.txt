Interpreter pattern defines a language's syntax and uses it to interpret sentences in that language. It is suitable when the syntax is simple, and efficiency is not a primary concern. Examples include java.util.Pattern, java.text.Normalizer, and subclasses of java.text.Format. The pattern helps create interpreters without building abstract syntax trees, translating expressions into other forms like state machines or using parser generators.
