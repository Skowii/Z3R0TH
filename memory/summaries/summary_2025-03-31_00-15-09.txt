Higher-order functions in JavaScript are functions that work with other functions, either as arguments or results. They enable abstraction, composition, reusability, and readability. Callbacks are a common type of higher-order function used in JavaScript for event handling and asynchronous code. An example using `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` demonstrates the power of higher-order functions in abstracting actions without rewriting algorithms repeatedly.
