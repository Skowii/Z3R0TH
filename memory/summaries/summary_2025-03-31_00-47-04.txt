Edit URL parameters in JavaScript by using the URL interface, which allows you to parse and edit the original URL string. This method takes care of encoding, hash fragments, and other complexities. To delete or add/edit parameters, use the searchParams object. For editing the hash fragment, use the URL.hash property. The URL interface offers various methods for editing different parts of the URL.
