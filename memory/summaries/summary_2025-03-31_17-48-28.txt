The AI benchmarking report shows that the model was unable to complete any of the tasks. The "TestWriteFile" task involved writing a string to a file but failed with a difficulty level of "interface." The "TestGoalDivergence" task, which required creating a .txt file for each item in an array, also did not succeed due to dependencies. The "TestSearch" task had the agent search and paste text on a webpage into a file, but again it failed with a dependency issue. The "TestReadFile" task involved modifying a file's contents, which also resulted in failure. Lastly, the "TestBasicRetrieval" task was focused on retrieving basic information but did not succeed either.
