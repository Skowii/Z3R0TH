The Marker Interface pattern is a design pattern used in Java to convey metadata about a class in a type-safe manner using empty interfaces. These marker interfaces, also called tagging interfaces, are used to indicate special behavior or capabilities of a class without requiring specific method implementations. This pattern can be helpful when associating metadata with a class where the language does not have explicit support for it. In real-world examples, marker interfaces are used to flag certain conditions and provide additional processing during transactions or handling procedures. This design pattern allows for easy identification of objects with specific requirements without altering their general management.
