Use JavaScript's `Element.requestFullscreen()` method to toggle fullscreen mode for an element on a webpage. The method is available in modern browsers except Safari, which does not support it yet. For customization, use the `navigationUI` option in `Element.requestFullscreen()`. Listen to the `fullscreenchange` event when fullscreen mode changes and the `fullscreenerror` event if the change is rejected. Fullscreen mode can be intrusive to users, so use it judiciously.
