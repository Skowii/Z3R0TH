A JavaScript stack is a linear data structure that follows the last in, first out (LIFO) order of operations. It behaves like a real-world stack of items, with new items added to the top and removed from the top as well. The main operations are push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. A stack implementation uses a class with a constructor that initializes an empty array for each instance. Methods include push (using unshift), pop (using shift), peek, and isEmpty (using length).
