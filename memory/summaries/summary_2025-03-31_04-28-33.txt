Private Class Data is a design pattern that aims to restrict the visibility of attributes in order to reduce their exposure. It encapsulates these properties within a single data object, reducing the number of class attributes. This pattern helps maintain data integrity and prevents unintended modification of unchangeable data. In practical examples, it can be applied by wrapping properties in an immutable data object, which then becomes inaccessible to mutating operations.
