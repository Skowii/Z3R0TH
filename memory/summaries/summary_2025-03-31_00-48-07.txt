This cheatsheet provides an overview of regular expression concepts used in JavaScript. It covers anchors, character sequences, quantifiers, groups, and flags:

Anchors:
- `^`: start of the string or multiline pattern
- `$`: end of the string or multiline pattern
- `\b`: word boundary
- `\B`: not word boundary (opposite of `\b`)

Character sequences:
- `.`: any character except line breaks
- `\w`: any word character
- `\W`: any non-word character (opposite of `\w`)
- `\s`: any whitespace character
- `\S`: any non-whitespace character (opposite of `\s`)
- `\d`: any digit character
- `\D`: any non-digit character (opposite of `\d`)
- `[abc]`: single character in the set, e.g., a, b or c
- `[^abc]`: single character not in the set, opposite of [abc]
- `[a-z]`: single character in the range between a and z inclusive
- `[^a-z]`: single character not in the range, opposite of [a-z]
- `[a-zA-Z]`: single character in either of the ranges

Quantifiers:
- `a?`: zero or one of `a`, equal to a{0,1}
- `a*`: zero or more of `a`, equal to a{0,}
- `a+`: one or more of `a`, equal to a{1,}
- `a{3}`: exactly 3 of `a`
- `a{3,}`: 3 or more of `a`
- `a{3,5}`: between 3 and 5 of `a` (inclusive)

Groups:
- `(ab)`: match and capture everything enclosed, e.g., exactly `ab`
- `(a|b)`: match and capture either one character, e.g., a or b
- `(?:ab)`: match everything enclosed without capturing, e.g., exactly `ab`

Flags:
- `g`: Global
- `m`: Multiline
- `i`: Case insensitive
- `u`: Unicode
