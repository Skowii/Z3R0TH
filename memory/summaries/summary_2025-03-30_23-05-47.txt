This article teaches how to create a list with floating or sticky section headings using CSS tricks. It uses the semantic HTML elements `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`. For floating headings, set the outer container to `overflow-y: auto` and use `grid-template-columns` for the inner container. Apply `position: sticky`, `top: 0.5rem`, and `grid-column: 1` to the headings for a floating effect. For sticky headings, set the outer container to `overflow-y: auto` and apply `position: sticky` and `top: 0` to the headings.
