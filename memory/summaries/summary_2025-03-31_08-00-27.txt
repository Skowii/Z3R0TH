Currying in Java is a technique that simplifies functions by breaking them into a sequence of single-argument functions. It's beneficial for functional programming and results in more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Real-world examples compare it to an assembly line where each station performs one operation before passing the partially completed task to the next station. Programmatically, it allows creating functions that take multiple arguments and breaks them into multiple single-argument functions, making complex tasks manageable and simplified in Java functional programming.
