Bucket sort is an algorithm used to sort an array of numbers. The implementation involves finding the minimum and maximum values using Math functions, creating buckets based on these values, and populating each bucket with elements from the original array. The sorted buckets are then combined into a final sorted array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + k), where n is the size of the input array and k is the number of buckets.
