To redirect a page from HTTP to HTTPS using JavaScript, follow these steps:
1. Check the current protocol using `location.protocol`.
2. If not already on HTTPS, replace the existing page with the HTTPS version by using `location.replace()` and appending the original URL without the protocol.
3. Use `location.href.split('//')[1]` to get the remaining part of the URL (without the protocol).
4. Replace the protocol in the original URL with "https://".
5. Call the redirection function, which will replace the current page with the HTTPS version.

This method ensures that the back button doesn't take you back to the HTTP page as it's replaced in history.
