The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern used in software engineering to enable an existing class's interface to be used by another, without the need for modification of the source code. It allows for a compatible interface to be presented for classes that would otherwise be incompatible due to differences in their interfaces. This can greatly enhance flexibility and reusability of existing code and components. The pattern is also often used as an intermediate layer between applications and third-party libraries, facilitating loose coupling and easy integration without modification of the application's code.
