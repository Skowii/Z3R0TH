The AI Shortform Video Creator is a tool that generates short-form videos using artificial intelligence and various customization options such as visual style, audio, and resolution. It works by taking user input for parameters like script, ratio, and voice. The block sends this information to the revid.ai API, which processes the request and creates the video. The final video URL is provided once it's ready. This tool can be used by social media marketers to quickly create engaging short videos for platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels without advanced video editing skills.
