The alt attribute on images serves as alternative information for a user who cannot view an image due to various reasons such as connection issues or screen reader use. Providing accurate and concise descriptions is crucial for accessible experiences. If an image is purely decorative, leaving the alt attribute empty signals screen readers to skip over it, different from not including it at all which would result in the file name being read.
