The Reactor pattern in Java is a non-blocking event-driven concurrency model that efficiently handles multiple simultaneous I/O operations using a single or limited number of threads, improving performance and scalability for high-performance network applications. It can be used to manage numerous service requests concurrently and is particularly beneficial in scenarios where an application must handle multiple clients sending service requests at once. The pattern consists of an event loop (reactor) that demultiplexes incoming requests and dispatches them to appropriate request handlers, enabling efficient task distribution and scalability in multithreaded environments.
