This code uses RELATIVE flag to list source files with their executable names and creates an executable using the file(GLOB) command. The AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY function is used to specify the directory. For each source file, a string replace is performed to cut off .cpp, and add_executable is called to create the target. Target properties are set with LINKER_LANGUAGE and CXX_STANDARD. OpenMP libraries can be linked if needed. The executables are installed in the "bin/sorting" directory.
