The Saga Pattern is used for managing long-running transactions across multiple microservices in distributed systems with resilience and fault tolerance. It ensures data consistency without locking resources. In the Saga pattern, a sequence of local transactions, or "chapters", are managed by coordinating transactions across different services and using compensating actions to maintain consistency. This pattern is particularly useful in microservices architectures where each service has its own database.
