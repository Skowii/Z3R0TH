The Repository Pattern is a design pattern in Java that simplifies data access by abstracting the details of data storage and retrieval from the rest of the application, enhancing maintainability and decoupling. A real-world example of this pattern could be a librarian managing book locations, hiding the complexity of storage and allowing patrons to request books easily. In Java, Spring Data can be used to create a PersonRepository that uses CrudRepository and JpaSpecificationExecutor interfaces, simplifying data access logic for persons.
