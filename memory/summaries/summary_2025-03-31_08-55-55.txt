This module provides the main window for the RP Renamer application. It uses PyQt5 and utilizes the collections, pathlib, and QtCore libraries. The main window class, Window, handles loading files, prefix text input, and renaming files. The window updates its state based on the number of loaded files and user inputs. It also enables/disables buttons accordingly for smooth interaction with users. The loadFiles() function loads selected files, sets up the UI, and updates the state. The renameFiles() function starts a QThread to perform the renaming operation using the Renamer class.
