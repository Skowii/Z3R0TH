Currying is a process that transforms functions with multiple arguments into a series of functions taking single arguments, improving flexibility and reusability. It involves creating curried functions using recursion or defining the arity of the function for more robust implementations. Variadic functions can be handled by defining the arity needed to call the original function. Uncurrying involves identifying the arity of the function before calling it.
