Convert a date to ISO extended format (ISO 8601) using JavaScript's built-in `Date.prototype.toISOString()` method for UTC time or by manually building the string with the timezone offset. Format a date to include the timezone offset by retrieving the timezone offset, converting it to hours and minutes, padding values, and reversing the sign if necessary. Check if a string is an ISO formatted date by comparing the result of conversion to ISO format with the original string.
