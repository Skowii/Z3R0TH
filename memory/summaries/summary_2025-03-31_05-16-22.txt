Collecting Parameter is a behavioral language design pattern that simplifies the process of accumulating data through multiple invocations of a method, rather than each path creating its own private collection. The pattern allows for results to be added to a central collecting parameter instead of having each method create their own data set. This improves code clarity and ease of modification as changes are made only in smaller methods.

An example from the real world: In a large shopping mall, there are shared printers that have different policies for printing. To implement this, we would need to build a program that can accept various printer settings and combine them into a central queue. This involves invoking smaller functions with each setting, adding information to a global data set as they go.

In code, this pattern could look like:
```java
public class App {
    static PrinterQueue printerQueue = PrinterQueue.getInstance();
    /**
     * Program entry point.
     * @param args command line args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Initialising the printer queue with jobs */
        printerQueue.addPrinterItem(new PrinterItem(PaperSizes.A4, 5, false, false));
        printerQueue.addPrinterItem(new PrinterItem(PaperSizes.A3, 2, false, false));
        printerQueue.addPrinterItem(new PrinterItem(PaperSizes.A2, 5, false, false));
        /* This variable is the collecting parameter. */
        var result = new LinkedList<PrinterItem>();
        /* * Using numerous sub-methods to collaboratively add information to the result collecting parameter */
        addA4Papers(result);
        addA3Papers(result);
        addA2Papers(result);
    }
}
```
