Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input array into sorted and unsorted subarrays, repeatedly finding the minimum element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the leftmost element. The implementation uses spread operator to clone the array, a for loop to iterate over elements, slice() and reduce() methods to find the minimum element, and swaps if necessary. The algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n^2).
