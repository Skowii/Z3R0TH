The Template Method pattern defines an algorithm's skeleton, allowing subclasses to override certain steps without changing the overall structure. This pattern is useful for maintaining a common set of behaviors among subclasses while enabling variations in specific steps. In the provided Java example, the StealingMethod class represents the template method with abstract methods that define various steps in a generic process. Subclasses, such as SubtleMethod and HitAndRunMethod, provide specific implementations of these steps without changing the overall algorithm structure. The HalflingThief class acts as a client to utilize different stealing methods by simply changing the associated StealingMethod instance.
