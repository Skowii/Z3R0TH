Text truncation is a tool used to prevent text from overflowing its container, applicable to both single and multiline texts. Single line text truncation involves using "white-space: nowrap", "overflow: hidden", and "text-overflow: ellipsis" in CSS. For multi-line text, use "overflow: hidden", "-webkit-line-clamp" to limit the number of lines displayed, and "display: -webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient: vertical". Note that "-webkit-line-clamp" is still a working draft and requires checking current browser support.
