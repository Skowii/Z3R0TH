To rename a local or remote Git branch, use these commands:

1. Local branch rename: `git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>`
2. Remote branch delete and push: `git push origin --delete <old-name>; git push origin -u <new-name>`
3. Combine both locally and remote: 
   a. Checkout the desired branch.
   b. Locally rename the branch with `git branch -m`.
   c. Delete old remote branch.
   d. Push renamed branch to the remote.
