DNS, or Domain Name System, translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. It consists of various types of records, such as A records (mapping domains to IPv4), AAAA records (for IPv6), CNAME (aliases), ANAME (root domain pointing), TXT (text notes for ownership or security purposes), and MX (mail server responsible for emails). Understanding these DNS records can be beneficial, even if not frequently used in web development.
