The article discusses implementing a Smallfuck interpreter in JavaScript for an esolang programming language. The interpreter follows these commands: `>`, `<`, `*`, `[`, and `]`. It is Turing-complete but has no input or output commands, so the interpreter runs the program and returns the final tape state upon termination.

The article approaches this by breaking down the interpreter implementation into smaller subsets and explaining them step by step:
1. Initialize the tape with the given input.
2. Set up a pointer to track the current position on the tape.
3. Iterate through the program, processing each command.
4. Update the pointer, bit state, or jump as needed based on each command.
5. Continue iterating until the program terminates due to an end of program or out-of-bounds pointer.
6. Return the final tape state as the result.

The author emphasizes the importance of understanding each step before building the full interpreter, helping readers grasp the concept and build their own implementation in JavaScript.
