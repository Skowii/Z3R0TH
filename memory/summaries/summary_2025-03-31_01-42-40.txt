A pure function is an important concept in functional programming, ensuring that given the same input, it always returns the same output and causes no side effects outside its scope. Examples of pure functions include addition, concatenation, and sorting, whereas impure functions may contain elements like random values or mutable data structures. Pure functions are more reliable and reusable, making them easier to reason about and preferable when constraints allow it.
