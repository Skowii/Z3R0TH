The project takes security seriously, requesting private reports of vulnerabilities instead of through public GitHub issues or pull requests. Outdated code in the "classic/" folder is not eligible for security updates. To report a potential issue, users can submit their report using one of the designated channels and work with the team to understand, validate, and resolve it. The project's supported versions are only those on the master branch or development commits. Users should always use the latest stable version and follow security documentation while keeping dependencies up-to-date.
