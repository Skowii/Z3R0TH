CSS can be used to create various shapes such as squares, rectangles, circles, ellipses, and triangles. The technique is less popular than using SVG or images but may be useful for simple shapes. To create a square or rectangle, set the width and height to desired values. For a circle, set border-radius to 50% with equal width and height, and for an ellipse, provide two different values for border-radius. Triangles are created using three borders with opposite sides having the same border-color and adjacent borders being transparent.
