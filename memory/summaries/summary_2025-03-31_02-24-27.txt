Function composition in JavaScript is a fundamental concept in functional programming that involves combining multiple functions to create a new function. The benefits include readability, reusability, and modularity. To create a compose() function, one can use Array.prototype.reduce(), iterating from right to left. Alternatively, a pipe() function can be created for left-to-right composition by reversing the order of functions.
