Simple Factory, also known as Static Factory Method, is a creational design pattern that encapsulates the creation of objects within a class and provides a static method to clients without revealing its implementation logic. This pattern allows refactoring code for a different database connection without modifying existing source code. It is useful when only focusing on object creation and managing objects in a codebase. Key benefits include maintaining all object creations in one place, preventing 'new' keyword values from spreading throughout the codebase, and supporting testability, maintainable code, replaceable components, extensibility, and isolated features. However, it may result in more complex code. Related patterns include Factory Method, Factory Kit, and Abstract Factory.
