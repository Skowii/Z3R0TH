The difference between JavaScript promise methods "then" and "finally" lies in their functionality. While both appear similar on the surface, they serve distinct purposes. "Then" accepts the resulting value of the promise chain, allowing you to change its resolved value. In contrast, "finally" does not receive a value and is used for cleaning up tasks (e.g., clearing timeouts or nulling references) after a promise's execution.
