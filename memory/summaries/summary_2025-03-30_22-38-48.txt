The useMutationObserver hook is a custom React hook that allows developers to easily utilize JavaScript's MutationObserver API in their components by watching for changes made to the DOM tree. It requires a ref element, callback function, and options object to specify what changes to watch for. The custom hook uses the useEffect() hook to set up the MutationObserver and watches the ref for changes, disconnecting when the component unmounts.
