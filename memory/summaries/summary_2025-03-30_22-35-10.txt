The React useClickOutside and useClickInside hooks help effectively handle click events outside or inside components using custom hooks. For outside events, useClickOutside uses a reference and event listener to check for clicks, while for inside events, useClickInside checks if the click occurred within the component. Both hooks require a ref and callback function for handling clicks.
