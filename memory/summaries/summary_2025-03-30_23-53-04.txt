This article discusses a formatting problem for day and hour ranges using JavaScript. The author encountered an algorithmic problem involving an array of objects containing day names and respective working hour ranges, which needed to be reformatted into an array of human-readable strings. The solution breaks down the problem into three subproblems: grouping consecutive days with working hours, formatting the grouped days, and adding missing days. By using Array.prototype.reduce() and looping over days of the week, the author creates a simple solution to format day and hour ranges in JavaScript.
