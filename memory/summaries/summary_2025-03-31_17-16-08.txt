This guide explains how to create a simple question-answer AI agent using AutoGPT's visual builder. Components required include an input block, AI Text Generator block, and output block. To set up the basic structure, add these components and connect them accordingly. Name the input block "question" and output block "answer." Save your agent, give it a name (e.g., "Q&A"), and run it to test its functionality. You can also create a simple calculator agent using two input blocks for numbers, a calculator block, an output block, and connecting the components accordingly. Save your agent, name it (e.g., "Simple Calculate Agent"), and execute calculations by entering values in the input fields and selecting the desired operation.
