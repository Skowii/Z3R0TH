Check if a given date is inside business hours using JavaScript's `Date` object. Use the `getDay()` and `getHours()` methods to retrieve the day of the week and hour of the day, respectively. Compare these values with predefined parameters (e.g., startDay, endDay, startHour, and endHour) to determine if the date is within business hours. Alternatively, use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for specific timezones by parsing the returned array of objects from `formatToParts()`.
