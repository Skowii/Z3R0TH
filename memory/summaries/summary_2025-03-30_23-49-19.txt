Pure functions are often compatible with random values through using JavaScript's deferred evaluation of function arguments. This allows a pure function to return different values based on input, while still maintaining predictable results when testing. An example would be: `const getNumber = (min = 0, max = 1, num = Math.random()) => Math.max(Math.min(num, max), min);` This method allows the function to return different values based on input without compromising its predictability during testing.
