Find all the keys in a JavaScript object that match a given value or condition. You can use `Object.keys()` to get all keys of an object and then filter these keys using `Array.prototype.filter()`. To find the first or last matching key, you can use `Array.prototype.find()`, `Array.prototype.findLast()`, or a combination of `reverse()` and `find()`. Be aware that JavaScript object keys are not ordered, so if order is important, consider using a Map instead.
