The given code is a Python script that allows users to animate spectrograms from WAV files using the waveio library and Matplotlib. The user can specify the window size in seconds, sliding window overlap percentage, and the path to the WAV file. The script uses the slide_window() function to create frames of the spectrogram by creating windows with a specified size and overlap, then applies Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to each window. These are plotted using Matplotlib's bar chart function, pausing between each plot for a specified time based on the input parameters.
