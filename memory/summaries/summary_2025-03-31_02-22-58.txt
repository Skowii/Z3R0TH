To detect if Caps Lock is on with JavaScript in a browser, you can use the [`KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/getModifierState) method with a value of 'CapsLock'. Listen for a keyboard event on an element and call `e.getModifierState('CapsLock')` to check the state of Caps Lock. Use the `'keyup'` event, as it works better across devices and browsers.
