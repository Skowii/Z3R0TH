This article discusses three ways to iterate and transform array data in JavaScript: for loops, array reduce, and method chaining. For loops allow control over iteration but are less common nowadays. Array reduce is more popular due to functional programming and can be chained with other methods. Method chaining uses map and filter functions, making the code more declarative and easier to read or refactor.
