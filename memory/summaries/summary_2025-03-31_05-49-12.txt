Callback is an idiom used in the Korean language. It refers to executable code that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a specific time or when certain conditions are met. In programming, callback functions are also known as "post-call" functions. They receive data from other code as an argument and are expected to be called again at a later time.

A simple example of using a callback would involve passing it to a task class that executes the task and then calls the callback afterward. This can be done with the following steps:

1. Define a simple interface that represents the callback, such as:
```java
public interface Callback {
    void call();
}
```
2. Create an abstract class called Task that extends from the previously defined interface:
```java
public abstract class Task {
    final void executeWith(Callback callback) {
        execute();
        Optional.ofNullable(callback).ifPresent(Callback::call);
    }
    public abstract void execute();
}
```
3. Create a subclass of the Task class that defines the execution:
```java
@Slf4j
public final class SimpleTask extends Task {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        LOGGER.info("우선순위의 작업을 마친 이후 콜백 메서드를 호출한다.");
    }
}
```
4. Use the task to execute a code and call the callback afterward:
```java
var task = new SimpleTask();
task.executeWith(() -> LOGGER.info("완료되었음."));
```

The Callback pattern can be applied when there is any asynchronous or synchronous operation that needs to execute after a specific action has been completed.
