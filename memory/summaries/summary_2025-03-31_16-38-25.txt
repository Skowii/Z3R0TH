The content discusses the need for API coverage when handling emails and considers two options for doing so. Using events is chosen as it allows triggering handlers once an operation is completed, making it easy to integrate additional logic after a command succeeds, enabling multiple operations, and gracefully handling mail server issues. It also enables sending emails asynchronously using commands and handlers which is why the direct email call in code option is not preferred.
