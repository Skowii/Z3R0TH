The Master-Worker design pattern enables parallel task processing for enhanced concurrency, scalability, and performance in software systems. It involves a master process delegating tasks to multiple worker processes, allowing them to work concurrently and report back. This pattern can be seen in real-world examples like restaurant kitchens, where the head chef assigns tasks to line cooks. In Java, the Master-Worker system is implemented through the `MasterWorker` class, dividing the work among `Worker` objects for optimal task processing efficiency.
