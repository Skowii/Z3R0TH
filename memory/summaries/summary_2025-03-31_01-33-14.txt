JavaScript allows merging objects using the spread operator and `Object.assign()`. However, these methods only perform a shallow merge and overwrite properties with the same key. To combine values with the same key or deeply merge objects, custom functions can be utilized. This involves iterating through keys and values of both objects to determine if they should be combined or maintained separately.
