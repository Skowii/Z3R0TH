The Client-Side UI Composition Pattern allows the assembly of modular UIs on the client side in a microservices architecture. It enables independent teams to develop, deploy, and scale UI components. This pattern helps with flexibility, scalability, and faster development cycles. Real-world examples include SaaS dashboards and e-commerce platforms. The programmatic example demonstrates the use of an API Gateway and FrontendComponents for data fetching and rendering on the client side.
