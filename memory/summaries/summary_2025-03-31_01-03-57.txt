Memoization is a technique that improves performance by storing results of previously completed tasks in a cache to avoid repeating work multiple times. It's useful for functions that are slow-performing or time-consuming, with the goal to speed up subsequent calls. Criteria for using memoization include having slow function calls and anticipating multiple calls under similar circumstances.

To memoize a JavaScript function, one can use a `Map` object to store key-value pairs, where keys are function's arguments and values are results. Alternatively, the Proxy object provides an alternative method by intercepting the function call and checking for cached results before calling the original function. This can significantly improve the performance of time-consuming functions.
