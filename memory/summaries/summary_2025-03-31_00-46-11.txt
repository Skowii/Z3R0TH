This passage explains the Event Loop in JavaScript. It is an essential part of the JavaScript engine and allows JavaScript to be single-threaded while executing non-blocking code. The Call Stack manages function execution, whereas Tasks and Microtasks are queued for execution by their associated functions. Task Queue follows a First In, First Out order, whereas Microtask Queue is executed after a task before rendering updates. This loop ensures JavaScript's functionality despite its single-threaded nature.
