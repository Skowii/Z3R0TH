Table Inheritance Pattern in Java is a method of modeling hierarchical data in relational databases. It involves creating separate tables for each class in the hierarchy, with the base class table storing common attributes and subclass tables storing unique attributes. This pattern allows for efficient representation of complex data models, particularly when subclasses have distinct properties. In relational databases, this pattern can be used to maintain inheritance relationships by linking primary keys between base and subclass tables. This method enables easier object mapping in Java while addressing the limitations of relational databases supporting inheritance.
