The Trampoline pattern is used in Java to implement recursive algorithms without exhausting the stack, and to interleave execute functions without encoding them together. It allows for tail-recursion optimization and can prevent stack overflows. This pattern is particularly useful in functional programming where the code may involve multiple function calls that need to be executed sequentially. The pattern involves creating a Trampoline interface with methods like get, jump, result, etc., and implementing recursive functions using these methods. A practical application of this pattern is found in the cyclops-react library.
