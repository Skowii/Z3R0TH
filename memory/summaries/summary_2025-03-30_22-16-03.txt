TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus aims to provide a platform for contributors to submit pull requests after reading these guidelines thoroughly. Issues should not be used for assignment, but rather contributions can be made through pull requests. Maintainers will evaluate the submissions. For new implementations, feel free to add new algorithms or data structures, improve existing ones, or fix documentation and test cases. Make sure your code follows the directory structure, uses `*.hpp`, `*.h`, or `*.cpp` extensions, avoids using `bits/stdc++.h`, and is well-documented with Doxygen standards. Stick to the guidelines for consistency.
