Observer pattern, also known as Dependents or Publish-Subscribe, is a design pattern that allows one object (the subject) to maintain a list of its dependent objects (observers) and automatically update them with any state changes. In the real world example, this could be like hobbits and orcs keeping track of weather conditions. The observer pattern involves registering as an observer to receive notifications about changes in the subject's state, and is implemented through interfaces and lists to manage observers. This pattern can be used when an object needs to notify multiple subscribers about changes in its state without being coupled directly.
