The Unified API initially used a prefix of `/new-api`, which wasn't clear about the version and was not future-proof. Two options were considered for versioning: URL-based versioning (using `/api/v2`) or using headers like Accept or custom header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.sylius.v1+json`). The decision was made to use the URL-based versioning method with the endpoint path being `/api/v2`, as it is easier and follows established patterns, but it does not block future usage of headers in addition to this path.
