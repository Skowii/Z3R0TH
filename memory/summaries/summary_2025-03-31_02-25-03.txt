Can I use an arrow function as the callback for an event listener in JavaScript?

Yes, you can use an arrow function as the callback for an event listener in JavaScript, but be aware of its implications on the `this` context. Arrow functions do not have their own bindings for `this`, resulting in `this` retaining the value of the enclosing lexical context's `this`. If you use an arrow function as a callback for an event listener, the `this` context will refer to either the global object (such as Window) or potentially silently fail due to incorrect references. To avoid issues, you can use the first argument of the callback function and `Event.target` or `Event.currentTarget`.
