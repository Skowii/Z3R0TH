In Node.js, you can access command-line arguments passed to a script using the `process.argv` array. The first two elements represent the path of the Node.js executable and the file being executed. To extract command-line arguments, use `Array.prototype.slice()` to remove the first two elements. Check if a specific flag is present by using `Array.prototype.includes()` and a regular expression to test its prefix.
