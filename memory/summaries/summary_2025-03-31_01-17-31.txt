JavaScript's switch statement can be replaced with object literals as an alternative syntax that is more readable, less verbose, and faster. To do this, create an object with a key for each case in the switch statement, then access its value using the expression you would pass to the switch statement. This technique also supports handling default cases, falling through cases, and extracting logic. A reusable function can be created to generalize and simplify this approach.
