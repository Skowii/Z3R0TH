The Page Controller pattern is a design pattern used in Java web development for handling requests related to specific pages or actions within an application, processing input, executing business logic, and determining the appropriate view for rendering responses. It enhances response handling and system architecture, and is often utilized in MVC architectures. In this approach, each page of a website is associated with a controller that manages HTTP requests for that particular page. The pattern is commonly implemented using Spring Boot or other enterprise frameworks, as demonstrated in the provided example.
