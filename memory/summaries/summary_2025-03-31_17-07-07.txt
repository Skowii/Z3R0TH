The Sylius API has introduced authorization using JWT tokens, accessible through separate endpoints for Admin Users and Shop Users. To use the new API, you need to generate SSH keys for JWT. Request a JWT token by sending an authentication request using email and password as provided in default fixtures. This will provide a token that must be passed in each request header. If using Api Platform Swagger docs, authorize by clicking the "Authorize" button and providing the token.
