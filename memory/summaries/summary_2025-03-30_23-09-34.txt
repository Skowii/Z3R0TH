Create a shadow matching the colors of an element using CSS by:
1. Positioning an absolute pseudo-element (::after) to fill available space.
2. Setting background: inherit for pseudo-element to inherit parent's background.
3. Offsetting the pseudo-element with top and applying blur() filter, opacity.
4. Setting z-index of pseudo-element to -1 for it to display behind its parent.
5. Adjust the blur() value to control shadow effect intensity.
