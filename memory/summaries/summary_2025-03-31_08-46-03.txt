The RadioStream class is used to decode audio streams from a given URL. It initializes a container using av library and gets the metadata using get_metadata function. The function returns an instance of WAVMetadata with details such as encoding, frames per second, and num_channels. The class supports streaming by iterating over the container's chunks, converting them to ndarray for yielding in the stream.
