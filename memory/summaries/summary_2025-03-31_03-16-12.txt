The Execute Around Pattern in Java is used for encapsulating pre and post execution steps, simplifying resource management and making code more reusable. Real-world examples showcase the pattern's use in handling setup and cleanup operations around a main operation, such as renting a car or writing text strings to files. Programmatically, this pattern can be implemented using a class that automatically opens and closes resources while allowing users to specify what actions are performed within those resources. This design pattern is beneficial for resource management tasks in Java applications.
