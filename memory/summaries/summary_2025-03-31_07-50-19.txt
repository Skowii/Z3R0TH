The Active Object design pattern in Java enhances efficiency in asynchronous processing by separating tasks into encapsulated objects with their own thread and message queue. This keeps the main thread responsive, avoiding issues like direct thread manipulation or shared state access. By decoupling method invocation from execution, the pattern improves concurrency and responsiveness in multithreaded applications. The pattern consists of six elements: a proxy, an interface, a list of pending requests, a scheduler, active object method implementation, and a callback for clients to receive results.
