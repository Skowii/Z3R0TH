The Renamer class in this module enables the renaming of multiple files using a custom prefix and number format. It emits custom signals for file progress, renamed file and completion. The renameFiles() function iterates through the given list of files, applies the prefix and number to their names, then renames each one with a 0.1-second sleep between them (comment out this line to speed up renaming). Signals are sent for each file processed and upon completion.
