This information discusses how to persist state in React using hooks and `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. The `useLocalStorage` hook returns a stateful value and a function to update it, while the `useSessionStorage` hook works similarly but uses `sessionStorage`. These hooks can have issues with accounting for changes to the storage due to other code, which can be addressed by listening to the `'storage'` event on Window and updating the state accordingly.
