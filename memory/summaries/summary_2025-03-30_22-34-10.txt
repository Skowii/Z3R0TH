The useBodyScrollLock hook is a custom React hook that locks the body scroll when a modal is open, preventing users from scrolling the content while the modal is active. It sets the `overflow` property of the `body` element to 'hidden' and restores it to its original value when the modal is closed. Implemented with `useLayoutEffect()`, it ensures that the scroll lock is applied immediately upon component mounting, and uses `Window.getComputedStyle()` to get the current overflow value and restore it when the component unmounts.
