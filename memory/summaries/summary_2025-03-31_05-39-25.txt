Bridge pattern, also known as Handle/Body, is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation so they can vary independently. This pattern promotes composition over inheritance. In the given example of weapons with enchantments, it allows for the enchantment to be applied or removed on the weapon without affecting its core functionality. This pattern enables greater flexibility and easier maintenance in software development.
