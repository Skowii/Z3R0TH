The Data Locality pattern in Java is a technique used to optimize performance by improving cache utilization and minimizing data access times, particularly in high-performance computing, real-time data processing, and game development. This design pattern arranges data in memory to take advantage of spatial locality, reducing data access times and enhancing cache utilization. It can be applied using the Data Locality module with a game loop that processes game entities and organizing them into different domains like AI, physics, and rendering components for more efficient access and improved performance.
