The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern separates business logic from database operations in Java. It achieves this by providing an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanisms, simplifying interactions and improving maintainability. By creating DAOs like `BookDAO` for specific data access tasks, the main application code focuses on business rules while the DAO handles complex SQL queries and data management, making the system easier to maintain and test.
