The Active Object design pattern is a solution to the problem of request-handler decoupling, where it separates the way requests are made from how they are handled, allowing concurrent processing without interleaving. In this pattern, objects have their own scheduler and handle operations by executing tasks in a specific order, rather than immediately after being created. It allows for parallelism while maintaining the ordering of requests. The Active Object class serves as an abstraction that delegates all method calls to a single internal thread, ensuring that only one task is executed at a time.
