This code creates an application that connects to a secure GRPC recommendations server. The server is assumed to be running on localhost and uses SSL authentication. The application takes user inputs for book category (such as mystery) and the maximum number of results desired. The application then sends this information to the recommendations server, which responds with a list of recommended books. This list is then used to populate the homepage template.
