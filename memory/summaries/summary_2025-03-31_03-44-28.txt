The Partial Response design pattern is a strategy for optimizing data delivery in APIs, allowing clients to process data as soon as it becomes available. This improves scalability and reduces server load. By returning partial responses instead of waiting for the complete response, it enhances performance and enables clients to start processing parts of the data even before receiving the entire response. Real-world examples demonstrate how this pattern can be applied in a restaurant setting or software systems. A programmatic example in Java shows how clients can request specific fields of a resource and a utility class converts video objects to JSON, only including the requested fields for efficient data transfer over the network.
