The Adapter Pattern in Java is a design pattern that enables seamless integration between two systems with incompatible interfaces. It works by converting the interface of one class into another interface expected by the client, creating compatibility. Examples of adapter patterns include card readers, power adapters, and language translators. In Java, an adapter can be created by implementing the desired interface and wrapping the existing incompatible class within it. This allows a class with an incompatible interface to work with other classes without modifying their source code.
