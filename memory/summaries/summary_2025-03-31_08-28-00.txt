The Event Sourcing pattern is a design approach that stores state changes as individual events instead of updating records in a database. It allows recreating the state of an application at any point in time by replaying these events. This provides benefits such as fault tolerance, robust audit trails, and transaction rollback capabilities. In Java, the pattern can be implemented with immutable historical records, where each event represents a set of changes to the data, managed by an `Event` class controlling thread operations for asynchronous processing.
