This script uses RELATIVE flag to list source files with their base names only, making it easier to extract executable names. It then creates an executable for each source file using a simple string replace method to cut off the .cpp extension and sets target properties. If OpenMP is found, the appropriate libraries are linked. Finally, the targets are installed in the "bin/machine_learning" destination.
