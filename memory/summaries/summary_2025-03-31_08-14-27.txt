The Service Layer pattern is a design solution for Java applications that separates business logic from presentation logic by encapsulating it in a distinct layer. This pattern promotes separation of concerns and provides a well-defined API for the presentation layer. In real-world examples, a restaurant system can utilize a service layer to manage orders, ensuring efficient operation and clear communication between different departments. The architecture diagram shows the structure of the Service Layer pattern, with services sharing functionality within each layer to reduce conceptual overhead related to managing service inventories. A Java implementation of the pattern demonstrates interactions between data access objects (DAOs) and business logic for clean separation of concerns in a 3-layer architecture.
