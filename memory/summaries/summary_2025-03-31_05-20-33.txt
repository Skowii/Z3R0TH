Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to parameterize and execute requests without specifying the underlying logic. This enables undo/redo functionality, supporting the rollback of operations. The Command pattern involves a client, a command object, an invoker, and a receiver. In code, the Command pattern is often implemented using an undo stack and redo stack, allowing for the execution and reversal of actions at specific times.
