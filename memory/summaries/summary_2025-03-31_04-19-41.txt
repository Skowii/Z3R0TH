Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that separates the creation of dependencies from their use. It involves injecting or passing objects and services into other objects, which helps to create loosely coupled applications that adhere to control reversal and single-responsibility principles. DI decouples the client's dependency creation from its own behavior, making it more flexible and maintainable.
