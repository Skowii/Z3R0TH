Implementing a library for readable regular expressions in JavaScript:
- Set up environment and designed the API using Vite and Vitest.
- The project is a simplified, readable, and reusable API on top of regular expression DSL, developed using TDD.
- The API is designed with users familiar with RegEx in mind, moving towards a more natural language approach.
- The interface uses simple naming, variadic functions, and named arguments for special cases like groups, lookaheads or quantifier counts.
- Exported function accepts an array of patterns and flags object to return a regular expression object.
- Implementation focuses on decision-making with the assumption that any pattern should be possible to test on its own (for TDD feasibility).
