Domain Model Pattern in Java: The Domain Model design pattern helps create a conceptual model that mirrors real-world systems, utilizing rich domain objects with both data and relevant behavior. It centralizes business logic, improving modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Real-world example - An online bookstore system uses the Domain Model pattern to manage books, authors, customers, and orders. Programmatic example in Java involves creating classes for Customer and Product, each incorporating both data and behavior. Data Access Objects (DAOs) provide an interface to the database for retrieval and saving changes.
