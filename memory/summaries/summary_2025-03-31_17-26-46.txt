Protocols are interfaces implemented by Components to group related functionality, and must be handled explicitly by the agent during execution. Built-in protocols are already handled in the built-in Agent, so when inheriting from the base agent, all built-in protocols work. Protocols can be order-independent or order-dependent, with the latter's order important due to possible dependency on previous components' results.
