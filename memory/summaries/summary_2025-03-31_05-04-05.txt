Dependency Injection is a software design pattern that involves injecting dependencies into objects so they can be used. It separates the creation of objects from their use, allowing for greater flexibility and improved testing. In this pattern, an object's dependencies are provided by other objects instead of being hardcoded, enabling better decoupling and reduced interdependence between classes.
