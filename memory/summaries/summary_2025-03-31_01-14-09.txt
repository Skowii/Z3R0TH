Using JavaScript's Proxy object, you can create chainable dynamic getters that return objects with values based on arguments received. The get trap checks if the argument is undefined and chooses the appropriate behavior: returning the property as-is or setting the value and returning a new Proxy object for chaining. This allows for more readable and concise code in situations where the shape of data is not known in advance or when values need to be manipulated before being returned.
