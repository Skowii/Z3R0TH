The "useInterval" hook is a powerful tool that helps manage intervals and side effects in React hooks. To utilize it effectively, place `setInterval()` inside the `useEffect()` hook, calling `clearInterval()` when unmounting. Additionally, use `useRef()` to access fresh values each time the interval runs and create a wrapper function to refresh the callback. Finally, convert this functionality into a custom hook for reusability.
