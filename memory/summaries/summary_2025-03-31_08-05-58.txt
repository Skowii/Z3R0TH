The Server Session Pattern in Java is a design pattern that helps manage user sessions securely, maintaining state across multiple client requests. It stores user session data on the server side, providing consistent and personalized experiences throughout web applications. A session token acts as a unique identifier, linking the user's preferences to their current interaction session. This pattern enhances security and user experience by managing user data on the server, rather than relying on client-side storage.
