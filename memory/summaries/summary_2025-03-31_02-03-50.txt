This article discusses immutable JavaScript objects using the Proxy object, as an alternative to freezing them with `Object.freeze()`. The author presents a code example that demonstrates how the Proxy object can be used to prevent mutations in objects regardless of nesting or complexity by trapping set and get methods. This approach offers a more versatile way to ensure immutability compared to simple freezing, making it useful for various use cases.
