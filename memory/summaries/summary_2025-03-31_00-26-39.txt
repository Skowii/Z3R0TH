JavaScript's built-in array sorting is not stable, as the ECMAScript specification does not require it to preserve the order of equal elements after sorting. To implement a stable sorting algorithm in JavaScript, you can fall back to comparing the element's indexes when their values are equal. However, this method is slower and doesn't sort in-place, as it requires additional mapping steps.
