Monolithic Ecommerce App: A Cohesive Application Model - The monolithic ecommerce app is a single, cohesive unit with all components tightly integrated and running within a single process. This simplifies development and deployment processes, offering ease of management and tight integration. However, it can be difficult to scale and maintain due to its rigidity. Monolithic applications use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for organization purposes. The MVC pattern separates concerns into three distinct layers: Model, View, and Controller, which helps maintain the principles of a monolithic architecture such as simplicity, testing, deployment, and scalability.
