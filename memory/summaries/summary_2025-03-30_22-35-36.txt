The article explains how to create a button with a ripple effect in React, inspired by Material Design's guidelines. To do this, the button consists of two main parts: the ripple circle and the button content. The ripple circle is animated using transform and opacity properties along with an animation keyframe. Positioning the ripple circle accurately is achieved by setting its left and top properties to the pointer's coordinates when the button is clicked. React state management through useState() and useEffect() hooks are used for button state and animation control, ensuring that the animation resets when not playing and the coordinates are updated on click.
