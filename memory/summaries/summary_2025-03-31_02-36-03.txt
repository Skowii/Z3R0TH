CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that blocks cross-origin requests to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive resources on other domains. It allows the server to specify which domains are allowed to make requests to its resources using CORS headers, such as `Origin` in the request and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response.
