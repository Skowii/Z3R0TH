This CSS tutorial demonstrates how to create an image overlay effect on hover. Using the `<figure>` element and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, you can produce top and bottom bars for the overlay, adjusting opacity, transform, and transition properties. The `<figcaption>` can be used for overlay text. By setting display, flex direction, and justify content, the text is centered into the image. With the `:hover` pseudo-selector, you can update the opacity and transform of all elements to display the overlay.
