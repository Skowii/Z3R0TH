The code compares three different methods to calculate the total sum of "total_views" from a data frame. It uses Timer to measure the execution time for each function. The functions are named after their respective methods, which are 'loop_sum', 'python_sum', and 'pandas_sum'. 'Loop_sum' uses a for loop while 'python_sum' and 'pandas_sum' use Python list comprehension and pandas series operations respectively to sum the total views. The data frame 'websites' is read from a CSV file with 1000 iterations of itself, and each method's execution time is measured within a Timer block for each function.
