The Poison Pill design pattern is used to gracefully shut down multithreaded applications by sending a special message (the "poison pill") to a message queue, signaling that no more messages will be sent, allowing consumers to terminate. This pattern provides decoupling, fault tolerance, and messaging capabilities for improved concurrency and system management. In Java, the Poison Pill pattern can be implemented using the Message interface and SimpleMessage class for effective thread management and consumer communication.
