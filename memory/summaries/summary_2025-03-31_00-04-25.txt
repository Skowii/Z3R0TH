The JavaScript Object API is limited, so we need to build on top of it for more complex operations. One use-case is filtering an object's properties based on keys or predicate functions. Using `Object.entries()`, we can get key-value pairs and then apply `Array.prototype.filter()`. To create new objects with only certain key-value pairs, use `Object.fromEntries()` after filtering. We can also implement inverse operations, such as omitting specific keys or values based on conditions.
