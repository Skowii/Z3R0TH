To display the right type of keyboard for form inputs on mobile devices, use the HTML `inputmode` attribute, which specifies the type of keyboard that should be displayed for an input field. Possible values include: `none`, `text`, `url`, `email`, `tel`, `search`, and `numeric`. The `inputmode` attribute acts as a hint to browsers about the desired keyboard, but it is not a replacement for the [`type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type) attribute, which specifies the type of data expected in the input field.
