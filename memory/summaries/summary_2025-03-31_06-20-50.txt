The Active Object design pattern separates method invocation from method execution, allowing each object to control its own scheduling of operations. It uses a thread to execute the methods concurrently without synchronizing the method invocations themselves. This pattern is used in asynchronous "sinkronaize" methods without self-synchronization. The example implementation involves logging and thread management in Java, allowing for any class that extends ActiveCreature to manage its own execution and scheduling of operations.
