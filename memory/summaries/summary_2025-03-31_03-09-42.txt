The Callback Pattern in Java involves passing executable code, or "callbacks", as arguments to other code for execution at a later time. This design pattern is useful for asynchronous communication and improving application responsiveness by separating task initiation from task completion. Real-world examples include restaurant pickup notifications and email systems that send messages after processing. A Java programmatic example of the Callback Pattern demonstrates executing a task and receiving a callback when it's finished, using interfaces and abstract classes.
