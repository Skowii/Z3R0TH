Check if an array has only one or many matches using JavaScript's Array methods. To check if an array has only one value matching the given function:

```js
const hasOne = (arr, fn) => arr.filter(fn).length === 1;
```

To find the index of the only matching element:

```js
const findIndex = (arr, fn) => arr.findIndex(fn);
```

For arrays with many matches, use the same approach but change the comparison operator to `>`. To check if an array has more than one value matching the given function:

```js
const hasMany = (arr, fn) => arr.filter(fn).length > 1;
```

To find all indexes of the matching elements, use `Array.prototype.reduce()`.

```js
const indexOfAll = (arr, val) =>  
    arr.reduce((acc, el, i) => (el === val ? [...acc, i] : acc), []);
```
