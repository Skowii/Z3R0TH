Zipping arrays combines their elements into a single array of arrays. To implement zipping in JavaScript, first determine the longest subarray, then use Array.from to create an array of appropriate length and map over the indices of original arrays to create a new array with the elements at that index. The inverse, unzipping, converts an array of arrays back into separate arrays by using reduce and forEach to map grouped values to individual arrays. If you want to zip an array into an object, use Array.prototype.reduce to assign key-value pairs.
