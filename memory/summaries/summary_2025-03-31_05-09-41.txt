Data Locality aims to accelerate access to memory by organizing data for use in temporary storage within the central processing unit (CPU). Modern CPU units have temporary storage memories for faster access to the main memory. This approach improves performance by increasing locality of data, which involves keeping it close to where it is accessed and in a suitable order. A class diagram shows the Data Locality pattern class. Data Locality can be used when there are performance issues due to loss of temporary storage. It requires ensuring that performance problems are due to memory loss. An example from the real world is the game engine Artemis, which uses simple patterns for Game objects.
