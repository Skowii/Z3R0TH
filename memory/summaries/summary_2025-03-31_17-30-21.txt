In Memory Challenge B, Follow-Instructions-GPT has to read a series of text files with instructions and keep track of the task IDs. The agent must follow the instructions and write all task_ids into the output.txt file after completing the challenge. This is tested by reading the instructions from various txt files and updating the current task_id as per instruction. Upon completion, it must use the 'task_complete' command to indicate task completion.
