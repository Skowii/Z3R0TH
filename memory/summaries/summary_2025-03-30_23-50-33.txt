The order of the "then" and "catch" methods in JavaScript promises is crucial as it can affect the overall behavior. Changing their order can lead to different results, with one being passed onto the next. This is particularly important when working with long and complex promise chains. Incorrectly ordered chained methods can cause issues, so always consider the sequence when working with promises.
