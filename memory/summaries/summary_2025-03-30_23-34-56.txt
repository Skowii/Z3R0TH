A guide on case conversion in JavaScript covers various conventions like camel case, kebab case, snake case, Pascal case, title case, and sentence case. To identify word boundaries, a regular expression is used for better results than relying on spaces or other delimiters. The expression can be broken down into identifying uppercase letters, word boundaries, single uppercase letters, digits, and using global flags to match all occurrences in the string. Converting any case to camel case requires splitting the string into words, transforming each word, and joining them back together while lowercasing the first letter of the final string.
