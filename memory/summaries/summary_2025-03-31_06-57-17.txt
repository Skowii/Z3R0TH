Twin Pattern is a design pattern that provides a standard solution for simulating multiple inheritance in Java. It enables the creation of two closely coupled subclasses that can act as a twin class with two ends. This pattern helps avoid the issues associated with multiple inheritance. In the example, a ball object needs to be both a `GameItem` and a `Thread`. The Twin Pattern is used by creating subclasses `BallItem` and `BallThread` that inherit from the respective parent classes. The two objects can then work together as needed.
