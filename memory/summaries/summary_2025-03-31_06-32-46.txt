Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows the creation of objects in a way that is independent of how they are instantiated, used, and concretely implemented. In simple terms, it is a way to create a group of related or connected things without having to specify which specific version you want; instead, it lets you use them without needing to know the exact details.

An example using Java:

1. Interfaces for Castle, King, and Army are defined. 
2. Elven implementations are created for Castle, King, and Army. 
3. Orcish implementations for Castle, King, and Army are also created. 
4. An abstract Factory is then created to create the related objects (Castle, King, and Army) without specifying their concrete classes.
5. The ElfKingdomFactory is used to create a Kingdom using Elven elements (ElfCastle, ElfKing, ElfArmy). 
6. Similarly, the OrcKingdomFactory can be used to create a Kingdom using Orcish elements (OrcCastle, OrcKing, OrcArmy). 
7. An object is created from each interface, and their descriptions are printed out.
