The key difference between prototypal and classical inheritance lies in their approach to object-oriented programming. In classical inheritance, there are two types of abstractions: objects and classes. Classes are used to define generalizations that other classes or objects will inherit from. In prototypal inheritance, however, only objects serve as abstractions. Objects can be created either out of nothing or from another object, with the latter becoming its prototype. This means that in prototypal inheritance, there's a single type of abstraction: objects.
