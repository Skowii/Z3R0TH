The Module pattern is a software module used to implement decoupling, especially in cloud-distributed systems. It is defined as a programming language that provides direct support for encapsulation, allowing the creation of modules with local variables and functions while preserving the object's integrity. In a class diagram, it can represent both acreational and structural patterns. The pattern can control the construction and composition of other elements, dividing them into groups similar to structural patterns. A naming convention is provided for a name-giving entity that supplies an initial state with cleaner, more compact syntax and governance.
