Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is a design pattern used in C++ template programming, which involves a class deriving from an instance of itself using the instance as a template parameter. It enables subclasses to inherit specific functionality from a base component compatible with their type. The pattern ensures methods accept parameters specific to the subtype and allows for matchups between fighters of the same weight class, preventing mismatches between fighters of different weights.
