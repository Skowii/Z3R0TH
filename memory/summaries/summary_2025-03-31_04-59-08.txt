Composite design pattern is a structural language that allows composing objects into tree-like structures to represent hierarchical relationships. This pattern enables the treatment of individual objects and object compositions in a unified manner. In software engineering, the composite design pattern represents a compositional approach for organizing objects. The goal is to compose objects into tree-like structures to model hierarchical relationships similar to "part-whole" relationships. This approach allows treating individual objects and object compositions in a uniform way. A simple example involves creating a class called LetterComposite with various types of printable objects like Letters, Words, and Sentences. The composite pattern is employed when dealing with messages as illustrated in the example code snippet.
