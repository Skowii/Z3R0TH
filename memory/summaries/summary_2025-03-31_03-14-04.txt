The Double Dispatch Pattern in Java enhances polymorphic behavior by allowing method behavior to be different based on the combination of runtime types of two objects involved in a method call, achieving dynamic polymorphism. This pattern is also known as multi-methods. In real-world examples, it can be used to optimize delivery strategies or handle interactions between game objects. The code for the Double Dispatch Pattern involves implementing an abstract class with overridden methods in subclasses, determining behavior based on both objects' types at runtime.
