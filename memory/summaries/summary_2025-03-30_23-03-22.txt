Create custom hover and focus effects for navigation items using CSS transformations by applying pseudo-elements to each list item. Utilize the `::before` element with a hidden state (e.g., `transform: scale(0)`) that transitions to visible when the element is hovered or focused (e.g., `transform: scale(1)`). Prevent the pseudo-element from covering the anchor element by setting an appropriate `z-index`.
