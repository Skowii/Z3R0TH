Create a toggle switch using HTML & CSS without JavaScript by structurally making it like a checkbox. Hide the `<input>` element and style the `<label>` element to look like a switch using the `::after` pseudo-element for the knob. Use the `:checked` pseudo-class selector to change the position of the knob and background color when checked. Ensure accessibility by keeping the `<input>` element in the DOM with added `aria-*` attributes.
