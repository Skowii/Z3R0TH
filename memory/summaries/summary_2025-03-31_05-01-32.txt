Acyclic Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows the addition of new functions to existing class hierarchies without affecting them, and without creating dependent circles as part of the GoF (Gang of Four) Visitor pattern. This pattern enables the visitor to traverse the classes in a hierarchy without modifying the classes themselves, allowing for more extensible software designs. It uses an interface called ModemVisitor and can be used when you need to add new functionality to existing class hierarchies.
