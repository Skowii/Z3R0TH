The usePortal hook is a custom hook that allows rendering of children outside the parent component in React. It utilizes state and effect hooks to create portals programmatically by using functions like `ReactDOM.createPortal()` and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`. The created portal can be removed using the returned function from the hook.
