Designing user-centric API for a JavaScript library involves creating an easy way to write and understand regular expressions. The goal is to make it more natural to describe patterns, reusable, and easy to read and maintain. This can be done by expressing regular expressions in natural language, making it easier for developers to create building blocks or libraries of RegExp patterns.
