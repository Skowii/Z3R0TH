The code uses the RELATIVE flag for listing source files with their relative paths, making it easier to extract executable names automatically. It then iterates through each source file and creates an executable using its name by removing the .cpp extension. If OpenMP_CXX is found, target libraries are linked accordingly, and finally, the targets are installed in a "bin/ciphers" directory.
