Type Object Pattern in Java allows for dynamic creation and management of flexible, extensible sets of related classes without altering the existing codebase. It is an ideal design pattern for developers who want to enhance flexibility and extensibility in their applications. The Type Object pattern involves defining a 'type object' class and a 'typed object' class where each instance represents different logical types. The typed object stores a reference to its type object, enabling the dynamic creation and modification of classes without changing the underlying logic. This design pattern is particularly useful for scenarios with unanticipated Java types or frequent modifications.
