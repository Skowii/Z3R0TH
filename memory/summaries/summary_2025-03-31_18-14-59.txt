The AI agent completed a benchmark with 4 tests in total, which took 954.35 seconds. The highest difficulty achieved was intermediate: 4. TestWriteFile involved writing the capital of America to a .txt file, TestPlanCreation required generating a plan based on booking a flight to Toronto and outputting it as a plan, TestGoalDivergence tested instruction following by creating .txt files for an array of items, and TestSearch checked if the AI could search for text. The agent successfully completed two tests (TestWriteFile and TestPlanCreation), while the other two had issues (TestGoalDivergence and TestSearch).
