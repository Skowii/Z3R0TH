The Single Table Inheritance pattern simplifies Java database schemas by storing an entire inheritance hierarchy in a single table. A type discriminator column distinguishes between different subclasses. This design pattern improves performance and schema simplicity by avoiding joins and unifying table structures. In real-world examples, this is applied to store items like books, magazines, and DVDs in a library system. Programmatically, the base class shares common properties, while special discriminator columns identify the subclass for each row.
