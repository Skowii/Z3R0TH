Linear search is an algorithm that finds the index of a given element in a JavaScript array by iterating through each element and comparing it to the target element. It has a time complexity of O(n) and requires a for...in loop with comparisons to find the element. If found, the index is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned. Use the built-in Array.prototype.indexOf() method in practical applications instead.
