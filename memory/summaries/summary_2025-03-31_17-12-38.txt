To contribute, avoid duplicate work, collaborate with fellow community members on bigger tasks, and post ideas in the dev channel. Create a draft PR for larger changes, adhere to code guidelines, and clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR. Always test and validate your code before submitting it and avoid making unnecessary changes based on personal preferences. Additionally, consider contributing in ways other than coding, following the contribution guide. To get involved with the project, read about Catalyzing and join the Discord server.
