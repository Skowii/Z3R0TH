Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing unit tests, which divides them into three clear steps: arranging the test setup and initialization, executing the test action, and asserting the test result. This structure makes code more readable and maintainable. It also enforces discipline in writing tests by forcing consideration of each step's purpose in the test. AAA makes it easier to write tests simultaneously.

A real-world example involves writing a comprehensive and clear unit test suite for a class called Cash. Using AAA, we can separate the steps of testing the class: arranging the test setup, executing the action, and asserting the result. This helps in maintaining a well-structured test code that is easy to read, maintain, and enhance.
