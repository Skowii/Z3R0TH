Interactive rebase in Git allows you to reorder, squash, and edit commits interactively on a branch. To perform an interactive rebase, use `git rebase -i <commit>`. This will open an editor with a list of commits and actions to perform for each one. You can use various options like 'pick', 'reword', 'edit', 'squash', 'drop', etc., to modify the commits. If you encounter merge conflicts or need to stop the rebase, you can continue using `git rebase --continue` or abort it with `git rebase --abort`. The `--autosquash` option automatically squashes fixup commits into the commits they are fixing.
