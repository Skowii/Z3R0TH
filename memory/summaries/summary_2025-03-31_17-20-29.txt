An RSS block retrieves entries from a specified RSS feed URL, filters them based on time period, and outputs the entries one by one. It connects to the provided RSS URL, fetches feed content, checks if entry's publication date falls within the specified time frame, formats, and outputs entry information. The block can be used for news aggregator applications that monitor multiple RSS feeds from different sources to display latest news items sorted by publication date and categorized by topic.
