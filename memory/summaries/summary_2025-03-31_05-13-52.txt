Dirty Flag, also known as IsDirty pattern, is a performance optimization technique used in Game programming. It helps avoid the costly re-acquisition of resources by retaining their identity and storing them in fast-access storage for reuse. The pattern is applied when repetitive acquisition, initialization, and release of the same resource causes unnecessary performance overhead.
